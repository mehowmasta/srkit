INSERT INTO `tadeptpower` VALUES (1,'Adept Spell','This power allows an adept to disrupt the mana flows within a target they have touched. Activating this power is a Simple Action and can be activated any time within (Magic) minutes from the time the target is touched (meaning the adept must have succeeded in a touch attack. The adept rolls Magic + Willpower [Astral] vs. Reaction + Intuition [Physical]. If the adept wins, the target suffers a glitch or accident as determined by the gamemaster. If the adept scores 4 or more net hits, it is considered a critical glitch with potentially catastrophic results. The adept must resist Drain (Body + Willpower) equal to the number of hits (not net hits).','Simple Action','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:HT'),(2,'Adept Accident','The adept has learned to cast a single spell like a mage. You learn one spell for free when acquiring this power. The maximum Force of the spell is your Magic Rating, and the Drain is always physical, resisted with Body + Willpower. This ability otherwise follows the standard rules for spellcasting. The adept can take ranks in the Spellcasting skill and is required to take at least one rank to use this power. This power can only be taken once.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:HT'),(3,'Adrenaline Boost','This power lets you accomplish more in one Combat Turn. You get +2 to your Initiative Score for the current Combat Turn for every level of this power you have. At the beginning of the next turn after the Adrenaline Boost, you take Drain equal to the number of levels you have in this power.','Free Action','',0.25,99,'1 Combat Turn',1,'Core'),(4,'Analytics','Adepts with this power can easily analyze, detect, recognize, and solve ciphers, patterns, or puzzles. This allows them to recognize clues or evidence during an investigation. For ever y level purchased, Analytics grants a +1 modifier to any test that involves pattern recognition, evidence analysis, obser vation, puzzle solving, or logic-based problems. It does not add dice to Technological Skill tests except for identification purposes. For example, Analytics doesn’t help with repairing a firearm, but it will help the adept recognize a knock-off.)  Analytics is not an immediate or instant solution to every problem. Rather, it’s meant to help the adept detect clues and glean information that could be overlooked (gamemaster’s discretion).','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(5,'Animal Empathy','This power gives the adept a greater affinity for all non-sentient animals, both normal and paranormal. For every level purchased, the adept gains +1 die to all Animal Handling tests. This power can also be used to intimidate or frighten animals.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(6,'Astral Perception','This power allows you to bridge the gap between the physical and astral realms and see into the astral plane. Since you’re dual-natured while you’re using astral perception, you can attack astral forms when you use this power. Follow all the normal rules for astral perception (p. 312).','Simple Action','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'Core'),(7,'Attribute Boost (Attribute)','You call upon inner strength to perform amazing physical feats beyond their normal abilities. Attribute Boost must be purchased for a specific Physical Attribute (Agility, Body, Reaction, or Strength); separate Attribute Boost powers may be bought for different attributes. This power cannot be purchased for a Mental or Special Attribute.  When you activate this power, make a Magic + Attribute Boost Rating Test. Each hit on this test boosts your attribute rating by 1, up to your augmented Attribute maximum. This only affects your dice pools; your Physical limit and Initiative ratings don’t change with Attribute Boost. The boost lasts for a number of Combat Turns equal to twice the number of hits you get. When the boost runs out, you take Drain equal to the level of this power.','Simple Action','',0.25,99,'2x Boost Hits',1,'Core'),(8,'Authoritative Tone','Adepts with this power can speak in a way that immediately makes people want to believe them and follow their orders. For every level of this power, an adept gains +1 die to any Opposed Social Skill Test that they initiate (normal limits apply).','Intrinsic','',0.50,3,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(9,'Berserk','The adept can voluntarily enter a frenzied mental state to increase his physical abilities. While in this state, the adept gains a +1 to all Physical attributes but suffers a temporary loss of –1 to all Mental attributes (minimum of 1; this power cannot be used by adepts with any Mental attributes starting at 1). Note: this also affects the adept’s Physical and Mental limits. Once activated, the adept remains in this state for (Magic x 2) Combat Turns or until any enemy targets are down. Adepts can attempt to leave this state early with a Willpower + Charisma (Magic x 0.5) Test. When the power wears off, adepts must resist Drain equal to (Magic x 0.5, rounded up).','Simple Action','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(10,'Berserker`s Rage','The adept passes melee berserking and delves deeper into a frenzied mental state. All bonuses and penalties from the Berserker power are increased to +2, and the duration is increased to (Magic x 4) minutes. To exit this state early requires a Willpower + Charisma Test. The threshold is 9 – the adept’s Magic Rating, with a minimum threshold of 3. If successful, the adept can use her full Mental attributes to resist Drain. Regardless of when she exits this state, the adept will have to resist a Drain Value of (Magic x 0.5). Any Wound Modifiers apply. A glitch on an exit attempt increases the duration to (Magic x 3) minutes.','Complex Action','Berserk',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(11,'Blind Fighting','Drawing on a special kind of sixth sense, an adept with this power is able to continue fighting even when he is blinded or deprived of vision. It reduces the penalty for Blind Fighting by 1. This power can be combined with the Strike the Darkness martial arts technique for a cumulative reduction of 2 (p. 141, Run & Gun).','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(12,'Cloak','Using the Cloak power, the adept has an increased chance of avoiding magical detection. For every level of this power, the adept gains a +1 die for opposing a Detection spell being used against her (see p. 285, SR5). Cloak does not prevent a magician or mystic adept from reading the adept’s aura through astral perception or viewing her from astral space; it just makes it more difficult to zero in on the targeted adept.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(13,'Combat Sense','Combat Sense provides an instinctive sense of any potential threats nearby. In defending against ranged and melee attacks, you get a +1 dice pool bonus to defense tests per level of this power. Adepts with this power are always allowed a Perception Test before a possible surprise situation, gaining the benefit of being alerted if the test is successful.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(14,'Commanding Voice (SR5:SG)','Adepts with this power have a knack for convincing people to believe them or do things for them in certain situations. For every level of this power, an adept gains a +1 die to any Opposed Intimidation or Leadership tests that they initiate (normal limits apply). If the adept succeeds, then the target(s) will agree to or follow the adept’s next suggestion or command, within reason and depending on the situation. A subject won’t normally harm himself for example, but he may be persuaded that the pretty-boy elf over there was making moves on his girl/guy and that punching said elf is a good idea. Or an adept may convince a corporate secretary to give up some dirt on her boss.  To keep this power in check, gamemasters can also grant targets a situational bonus based on how inclined the subject would be to believe the adept. An adept can attempt to use this ability on up to (Charisma) people at a time, with a –1 dice pool for any additional subjects.','Intrinsic','',0.25,3,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(15,'Commanding Voice (SR5:SSo)','This power channels the adept’s magic into his voice to enhance the modulation and pitch, subliminally influencing the actions of any listeners. The adept takes a Complex Action to give a simple but forceful command (five words or less) to the target, making an Opposed Test with Leadership + Charisma against the target(s) Willpower + Intuition. If the adept succeeds in the test, the target uses his next action to either carry out the command or stands confused (gamemaster’s choice, but the more net hits achieved the more likely it is for the target to obey the adept’s command). Such commands carry no weight beyond the immediate impetus, and the affected characters will quickly reassert their wits, returning to their original course of action. If multiple individuals are targeted, use the largest dice pool among the defenders and add 1 die per additional target (to a maximum of six individuals). Commanding Voice may only be used on metahumans who can directly hear and understand the adept’s words. It has no effect when the voice is amplified or broadcast via technological means (e.g., wireless transmission or loudspeaker). It is also less effective on subsequent uses against the same target. Apply a cumulative –2 dice pool penalty for each use within the preceding 24 hours.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSo'),(16,'Cool Resolve','Adepts with this power are extremely confident and self-assured in social interactions. This includes situations such as negotiations with a Mr. Johnson, running a con on the street, staying in-character while undercover, or resisting the tender inquiries of a professional interrogator. Each level gives the adept +1 die in all Opposed Tests involving Social skills, regardless of whether they initiated the action or are resisting someone else’s social skills.','Intrinsic','',1.00,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(17,'Counterstrike','Counterstrike is an extremely potent ability that allows an adept in unarmed combat to redirect an attacker’s energy through a combination of skill, intuition, and magical ability. To employ this power, an adept must first use a successful Block action against an incoming attack and spend her next available action to make a melee combat attack. For the adept’s next melee combat attack test, add a number of dice equal to her levels in Counterstrike and the net hits from the Block. Engaging in any other action before attacking, even Dodge or Full Defense, negates the bonuses gained from this power. This power cannot be combined with the Counterstrike and Opposing Force martial arts techniques (p. 124 and 139, Run & Gun).','Interrupt (-5 Initiative)','',1.00,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(18,'Critical Strike (Skill)','This power improves a specific melee skill: either Unarmed Combat, Clubs, Blades, Astral Combat, or a particular Exotic Melee weapon skill. The specific skill is chosen when you buy the power. Increase the DV of your attacks with the selected skill by 1. Critical Strike is compatible with weapons and other adept powers. The power may be selected multiple times, each time for a different melee skill.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'Core'),(19,'Danger Sense','You are instinctively sensitive of your surroundings and of impending threats that may not be immediately visible. It’s the bad feeling that the character gets before walking into a trap, the gut instinct that makes them jump an instant before trouble hits. For each level of this power, you get +1 die on Surprise Tests.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(20,'Demara','This power grants the adept the ability to use an untrained skill at minimal effectiveness after watching a person or recording of a person using the desired skill. Once the adept has watched their reference material for at least one hour, they can use the skill as if they have a skill rating one. This knowledge remains effective for a number of hours equal to the adept’s Magic Attribute. The ability does not provide any Karma assistance in learning a skill through character creation or advancement.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Magic Hours',0,'SR5:SSp'),(21,'Eidetic Sense Memory','An adept with Eidetic Sense Memory is capable of memorizing all sensory input, including tastes, smells and textures in addition to the more traditional visual ability. The adept is capable of perfectly recalling any sensory stimulus, or combination thereof. The memories can be recalled at will. The adept also has the ability to photo-read, making it a great trick for those Awakened who like book clubs.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(22,'Elemental Body','An evolved version of Elemental Strike and similar to the critter power Elemental Attack, Elemental Body creates an elemental field that envelops the adept. This field forms approximately three to five centimeters from the adept’s body and can be used offensively and defensively.  To activate this power, the adept must spend a Complex Action channeling the desired element. For offensive purposes, treat Elemental Body like the Elemental Strike power, with a DV of (Magic x 2)P and AP –(Magic x 0.5). For defense, anyone or thing coming into contact (melee or unarmed strike) with the adept while Elemental Body is active must resist the same DV and elemental effect as the offensive strike; fast-moving projectiles such as bullets or thrown weapons are unaffected. Items already on the adept’s body or held by the adept are not damaged, but they do not gain any elemental effect.  Elemental Body lasts for (Magic) Initiative Passes or until the adept is rendered unconscious. This power can be deactivated at will using a Free Action before the time limit expires. Once deactivated, the adept must resist a Drain Value of (Magic x 0.5) + the number of Initiative Passes the power was active. Only one effect can be used at a time, and each elemental effect must be purchased as a separate power.','Complex Action','Elemental Strike',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(23,'Elemental Strike','Elemental Strike enhances the damage caused by an unarmed Killing Hands strike by channeling an elemental effect into the attack. Activating this power requires a Simple Action and the effect remains active for (Magic) Combat Turns or until the adept deactivates it with. Free Action or is rendered unconscious. While active, the chosen elemental effect wreathes the hand, foot, or other body part the adept uses to strike. Only one effect can be used at a time and can’t be combined with any other adept striking power except Killing Hands. Each elemental effect must be purchased as a separate power.','Simple Action','Killing Hands',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(24,'Elemental Weapon','Similar to Elemental or Toxic Strike, Elemental Weapon allows an adept to channel an elemental effect (normal or toxic) through her weapon focus instead of her hands. A Simple Action is required to first channel the desired elemental effect. Elemental Weapon remains active for (Magic) Combat Turns or until the adept deactivates it with a Free Action or is rendered unconscious. Only one elemental effect can be used at a time, and each elemental effect must be purchased as a separate power. This power can also be used with other powers that enhance an adept ’s Accuracy or skills related to foci.','Simple Action','Weapon Foci',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(25,'Empathic Healing','Used only in the direst of circumstances, the Empathic Healing power allows an adept to literally take on the wounds of another in order to heal them. To accomplish this, the adept rolls a Magic + Willpower Test. For every hit, one box of Physical damage transfers from the wounded target to the adept’s damage track. Only Physical damage can be healed in this way.  Subjects with lower than normal Essence, due to augmentations or Essence loss, are more difficult to heal. Apply a negative modifier equal to the subject’s lost Essence (6 – current Essence Rating, round down) to the dice pool for the adept’s healing test. The test itself requires two full Combat Turns per box of damage to complete, and the healing adept must maintain physical contact during the entire process. Damage modifiers are applied once the adept completes the process.','2 turns per box','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(26,'Enhanced Accuracy (Skill)','A weapon in your hands becomes an extension of your body. When you buy this power, choose a Combat Skill (Pistols, Clubs, Heavy Weapons, etc.). When you use the skill, add 1 to the Accuracy of the weapon you’re using. This power cannot be used with Unarmed Combat, but it can be purchased multiple times with a different skill each time.','Intrinsic','',0.25,1,'Constant',0,'Core'),(27,'Enhanced Perception','This power sharpens all your senses. Add +1 die per level to all Perception Tests and Assensing Tests.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(28,'Enthralling Performance','This adept power is used in conjunction with an artistic skill, such as Artisan or Gymnastics, which the adept must also possess. This power can be selected multiple times, with each selection pertaining to a different artistic skill. If the gamemaster allows, this power may also be linked to Unarmed Combat (Martial Arts) or Con (Impersonation).  The power permeates the adept’s performance with a subtle magic aura, mesmerizing observers with the adept’s grace or skill as the performance unfolds. The adept makes a test of the appropriate skill + Magic. The adept’s hits serve as a threshold modifier for any Perception tests the audience might make during the performance. Audience members exposed to sudden outside stress or stimuli, such as hearing gunshot or suffering an assault, are immediately released from the entrancement.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(29,'Facial Sculpt','This power allows an adept to change his appearance by shifting the muscles, bone structure, and cartilage in his face. Each level purchased gives the adept a +1 dice pool modifier for Disguise Tests. The effect can be sustained for (Magic) hours.  Common changes include altering ear shape, changing nose shape, raising/lowering cheekbones, growing tusks, reshaping the forehead, lengthening/shortening facial hair, and so on. Adepts can even change their face to another metatype of they wish, but they can’t change their body shape. The time required to change one feature is approximately one minute. Multiple features can be changed simultaneously with a Body + Magic Test, with each hit resulting in one additional change. The adept needs another full minute to undo the changes and return their features to normal.','Complex Action','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(30,'Feign Death','Like the Feign Illness power, Feign Death allows the adept to mimic death with enough accuracy to fool observers, biomonitors, and even medkits. The adept can maintain the power for a number of hours equal to her Magic attribute. The adept sets a time limit when she will come out of the comatose state; the only way to wake her up early is to send a message via a Mindlink spell containing a pre-arranged trigger phrase. Physical contact, injury, loud noise, and so on have no effect on the death-mimicking adept. Any attempts to diagnose signs of life must exceed a threshold equal to the adept’s Magic attribute. The adept is unaware of her surroundings while in this state; she doesn’t hear any conversations taking place or see who is coming and going in their surroundings.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:BB'),(31,'Feign Illness','This power allows an adept to mimic the signs and symptoms of an illness with enough accuracy to convince all but the most skilled observer. The power even creates real physiological changes such as fever and increased heart rate, which can fool a biomonitor or medkit. The adept can maintain the power for a number of hours equal to his Magic attribute. Any attempts to diagnose the illness as false must exceed a threshold equal to the adept’s Magic attribute.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:BB'),(32,'Flexibility','Adepts with the Flexibility power can bend or twist their bodies past the metahuman norm, which allows them to squeeze through openings smaller than the adept (gamemaster’s discretion) and escape restraints easier. It also makes and adept harder to subdue during unarmed combat. For every level of Flexibility the adept possesses, the threshold for moving through cramped corners or getting out of restraints is lowered by one. During unarmed combat, if someone is attempting to subdue the adept, the adept gains +1 die per level of Flexibility to prevent being subdued; normal limits still apply.','Intrinsic','',0.25,3,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(33,'Focused Archery','This ability allows an adept to focus their qi and draw a bow that they normally would not be strong enough to use. Solely for the purposes of determining the maximum Rating of bow they are able to fire without penalty, an adept can treat their Strength as 1 higher for each level they have in this power. If an adept using this power fires a bow more than once in a Combat Turn, they must resist Drain equal to twice the number of levels they have in this power at the beginning of the next Combat Turn.','Intrinsic','',0.25,3,'Constant',0,'SR5:HT'),(34,'Freefall','This power helps adepts absorb the damage from a fall or jump down for a specific distance. This ability does not help the adept increase the distance he is jumping, such as with the Light Body power. Every level of Freefall allows the adept to fall or jump down 3 additional meters without any adverse effects (beyond the three meters normally allowed). When calculating fall damage past his personal distance threshold, subtract the overall level bonus from the Damage Value of the fall and then apply damage normally (see p. 172, SR5). This means that an adept with Freefall receives no damage from a fall of six meters or less, rather than the typical three meters. Beyond that, if an adept with two levels of Freefall falls 15 meters, the power negates 6 points of damage from the fall, changing the Damage Value of the fall from 15P to 9P (the fall’s AP remains unchanged). As long as the adept experiences no damage from the fall (either because the fall was short enough to cause no damage or because they successfully resisted all applicable damage using Body + Armor, the fall counts as a normal move action, and can be combined with an attack. Any other means of dealing with the damage does not allow this opportunity. Longer falls count as a Complex Action.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(35,'Hang Time','Adepts with this power receive two benefits. First, for each level of this power, the adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus for all Climbing Tests. Second, the adept can temporarily adhere to surfaces, such as walls. For each level of this power, the adept can attach himself to a surface and hang out for approximately five minutes, provided he remains motionless and keeps physical contact with the surface in question with hands, feet, knees, or elbows. The adept must spend a Simple Action to bond his magical energy with the surface; normal clothing such as gloves or boots does not interfere with this power, but the use of heavy armor (armor with a Rating of 13 or higher) will. Moving the attached body parts on the surface they’re adhering to, such as a moving vehicle, breaks the bond, making the adept fall off.','Simple Action','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(36,'Heightened Concern','The adept can ignore a single distraction while performing another task. This power negates a single situational modifier of a value of up to half (rounded up) of their Magic Attribute. It takes a Complex Action to activate and may be combined with the Adept Centering metamagic.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(37,'Improved Ability (Skill)','This power increases the Rating of a specific Combat, Physical, Social, Technical, or Vehicle skill per level of the power. You need to know the skill in order to buy this power for it, and you can’t buy it for skill groups. The maximum improvement possible is your current skill level x 1.5 (rounded up).','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(38,'Improved Physical Attribute','This power allows you to increase a physical attribute (Body, Agility, Reaction, and Strength). This augments your attribute, so your Physical limit may also increase with the new Attribute rating. This power allows you to exceed your natural Attribute maximum, up to your augmented maximum.','Intrinsic','',1.00,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(39,'Improved Potential (Limit)','This power allows an adept to raise one of your inherent limits (Physical, Mental, or Social), specified when you buy the power, by 1. You may buy this power multiple times, once per inherent limit.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(40,'Improved Reflexes','This power increases the speed at which you react, just like wired reflexes. For each level, you receive +1 to Reaction (this also affects Initiative) and +1D6 Initiative Die (to a maximum of 5D6). The maximum rating of Improved Reflexes is 3, and the increase cannot be combined with other technological or magical increases to Initiative.','Intrinsic','',0.50,3,'Constant',0,'Core'),(41,'Improved Sense','This power gives you sensory improvements not normally possessed by your character ’s metatype. These improvements may include low-light or thermographic vision, high or low frequency hearing, and so on. Any sense enhancement provided by cyberware or bioware can be provided by this power, unless that enhancement either gives you bonus dice to Perception Tests or needs wireless to work (or both).','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(42,'Indomitable Will','The adept has an increased resistance to fear and torture. The adept gains a +1 dice pool modifier to Opposed Tests to resist Intimidation and fear-inducing effects or powers for each level of this power.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(43,'Inertia Strike','This power allows an adept to generate and channel extra energy into an unarmed or melee strike specifically intended to knock a target down. To use this power, the adept must first declare her intention by spending a Free Action before the actual strike to channel the necessary energy. If the adept is successful with the attack, she adds (Magic x 0.5) to her Damage Value solely to determine if a knockdown occurs (p.194, SR5) Inetia Strike does not change the actual Damage Value of the attack. Using this power is considered a Called Shot (see p. 195, SR5). Note: This power cannot be combined with the Imposing Stone Martial Arts Technique (p. 138, Run & Gun).','Free Action','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(44,'Iron Gut','This power greatly increases the strength of the adept’s digestive tract, allowing them to ingest and metabolize a wider array of substances than the metahuman norm. The power grants the adept a +1 dice pool modifier on any ingested Toxin Resistance Test (p. 409, SR5) per level of the ability.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(45,'Iron Lungs','This power increases the adept’s lung capacity. When attempting to hold one’s breath, each level of Iron Lungs increases the base time of holding one’s breath by 20 seconds. When wanting to extend past the base time, each level adds an additional 6 seconds for each net hit on a Swimming + Willpower Test (added on top of the normal 15 additional seconds per net hit). So at four levels, the adept’s base time is 140 seconds (60 seconds normally, plus 80 (that is, 4 x 20) seconds from the power). Each net hit on a Swimming + Willpower Test extends the clock by 39 seconds (15 seconds as a base plus 4 x 6, or 24). The power also adds a +1 dice pool modifier to Body to resist Fatigue damage from Running (p. 172, SR5) per level.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(46,'Iron Will','This power makes the adept more resistant to external influences. The character may add the power’s level as a dice pool modifier in tests to resist mental manipulation or mind control, whether originating from spells, adept powers, or spirit powers.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(47,'Keratin Control','The adept has the ability to accelerate their hair, nail, and horn growth within the limits of the adept’s metatype. The adept can go from short, professional appearance to street chic in a matter of hours. The power also allows any hair grown to be straight or curly at the adept’s discretion. Full beards and long hair normally take six hours to grow, but the growth can be accelerated at the cost of one unresisted box of Stun Damage per hour reduction in growth time.','Free Action','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(48,'Kiai','The adept summons up their qi to let out a terrifying battle cry that can send their foes fleeing. This power affects everyone who hears it, whether friend or foe, within a radius of (Magic) meters. The adept makes an Opposed Test using its Magic + Kiai Rating against the target’s Logic + Willpower. Any bonuses against fear, such as the Guts quality, are added to the target’s Opposed Test. If the target wins, they suffer no ill effects. If the adept wins, the victim takes a –2 penalty to all actions for a number of Combat Turns equal to the net hits. If the adept’s net hits exceed the target’s Willpower, the victim flees in terror until they are safely away and out of sight of the adept. Even once the fear fades, the target must succeed in a Willpower + Logic (adept’s net hits) Test to gather the nerve to face the adept again. At the end of the Combat Turn, the adept takes Drain equal to the level of this power. They may attempt to soak the drain with Body + Willpower.','Intrinsic','',0.25,6,'Constant',0,'SR5:HT'),(49,'Killing Hands','This power lets you inflict lethal damage with your unarmed attacks. When inflicting damage on the target of an unarmed attack, you may choose whether to cause Stun or Physical damage. Killing Hands may be combined with other adept powers that increase unarmed damage. Your Killing Hands attacks are magical, so they can bypass a creature’s magical defenses against attack, such as the Immunity to Normal Weapons power, and may be used by adepts with Astral Perception during astral combat.','Free Action','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'Core'),(50,'Kinesics','Kinesics grants you complete control over your body’s nonverbal and subconscious communication and social cues, even when you’re in stressful social situations. It includes facial expressions, body movements, eye movements, fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure, and even control over sweat glands, making it difficult to gauge your emotional state and truthfulness. Add +1 to resist Social Tests and tests to read your emotions like Judge Intentions, assensing, or truthfulness tests.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(51,'Kinesics Mastery','An advanced version of Kinesics (p. 310, SR5), this power allows two adepts with this ability to communicate with each other while using solely non-verbal cues, such as body language and minute facial expressions, and natural subconscious cues. While general messages and mental states are easily relayed, those with Kinesics Mastery can relay specific, detailed information such as locations, names, places, or numbers. Communication in this way requires adepts to have direct line of sight and be close enough to read each other’s facial features and body language, whether through natural, augmented, or magical means.','Intrinsic','Kinesics',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(52,'Light Body','Light Body is used to make incredible jumps over long distances. Add the power’s level to your Agility before calculating maximum distance you can jump. Also, add 1 die per level to your Gymnastics Test when you make your jump. If you should happen to fall, reduce the effective distance of a fall by the level in meters when calculating your falling damage.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(53,'Light Touch','Light Touch allows the adept greater control in palming or pickpocketing an object and preventing anyone from perceiving the act. It imposes a –1 Perception dice pool modifier per level of Light Touch to anyone observing or being targeted by the adept.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSo'),(54,'Linguistics','Through enhanced memory and mimicry, adepts with this power are able to learn new languages after a minimal amount of exposure to it, without spending Karma. To learn a new language, an adept must be exposed to the new language for (12 – Magic Rating) hours, (minimum 1 hour). The adept then makes a Logic + Intuition Test using the Linguistics Table. If successful, the adept gains the language at Rating 1. Further development of the new language requires normal Karma expenditure.','Intrinsic','',0.25,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(55,'Living Focus','This power allows the adept to sustain a spell in a manner that simulates a Sustaining Focus. The casting magician does not need to maintain the spell but can transfer the spell to the adept with a Simple Action, with the adept providing the mana to power the spell. The spell cannot be further transferred, even if the recipient has the Living Focus power. The spell’s Force cannot exceed the adept’s Magic Attribute, and while sustaining the spell the adept suffers a –2 dice pool modifier to all actions while they sustain the spell. Counterspelling the sustained spell is handled with Dispelling (p. 296, SR5)','Free Action','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(56,'Maintain Warmth','Maintain Warmth allows the adept to delay the onset of hypothermia and other cold-related ailments. This eliminates any modifiers to the Survival Test due to weather (see Survival Test Table, p. 137, SR5).','Intrinsic','',0.25,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(57,'Magic Sense','Magic Sense allows an adept to detect the use of magic in her vicinity. Treat this power as the Detect Magic spell (p. 287, SR5) but with a range equal to (Magic x 10) meters. Adepts with the Astral Perception power can also use Magic Sense to detect astral forms while perceiving the astral plane.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(58,'Master Archer','An adept with this ability has no equal when wielding a bow. Any Action Phase in which the adept uses the Fire Bow Simple Action or the Load and Fire Bow complex action, they can ignore 2 points of negative dice pool modifiers due to their own movement. In addition, any ranged attacks the adept makes with a bow gains +1 die.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:HT'),(59,'Melanin Control','This power allows the adept to change the color of his skin and/or hair to that of another ethnicity/metatype, limited to the colors normally found in metahuman genetic expressions. The shift costs a Complex Action and lasts for (Magic) hours.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(60,'Memory Displacement','This adept power allows an adept to temporarily remove selected memories for a predetermined amount of time with the use of a Complex Action. While the memory is displaced, the adept has no recollection of the erasure or its contents, rendering attempts at Intimidation, Interrogation, or mental manipulation spells ineffective, except for any physical trauma caused. Once the predetermined time has elapsed, the memory returns.','Complex Action','',0.25,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(61,'Metabolic Control','An adept with this power has the ability to enter a deep meditative state where all metabolic processes are slowed. This has two benefits. The first is to reduce the amount of rest the adept needs. In game terms, for every hour the adept in this state, she increases the interval for taking fatigue damage from sleep deprivation by another three hours (see p. 172, SR5).  The second benefit preserves the adept’s life in emergency situations. When the adept goes into Physical overflow damage, he immediately goes into this meditative state. While in this state, the adept only takes an additional box of overflow damage every (Body) hours. An adept can exit this state whenever he wishes, but doing so while severely injured causes all wounds or toxins to immediately take effect unless treated or healed.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(62,'Mimic','Mimic allows an adept to be able to mystically copy fingerprints, palm prints, and retinal prints and temporarily imprint those patterns onto his own body. For each level of Mimic, the character can receive 1 die to use to fool a print scanner. The adept must spend 1 minute in physical contact with the target, with each minute increasing the quality of the copy. The highest copy that can be produced of these prints is Rating 6 (which requires 6 minutes of contact with the target). The copies of the prints last for (Magic Rating of the adept) minutes before the adept’s body reverts back to its natural patterns.','Intrinsic','',0.25,6,'Magic Minutes',0,'SR5:SSo'),(63,'Missile Mastery','In the hands of an adept with Missile Mastery, everyday items such as bottles, credsticks, tools, empty clips, flashlights, cooking utensils, and so on can be turned into deadly weapons. Such improvised weapons have a Damage Value of (STR)P with an Accuracy of 3. The adept can also declare whether these weapons do Physical or Stun damage. Additionally, adepts with this ability have a greater affinity for throwing weapons. For ranged attacks with non-explosive throwing weapons, the adept gains +1 die and adds +1 to the weapon’s Damage Value.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(64,'Missile Parry','You can catch slow-moving projectiles such as arrows, thrown knives, grenades, or shuriken out of the air. When using this power, add +1 die per level to your defense pool against the attacker’s ranged attack test. If you generate net hits, you pluck the missile out of the air. You need to have at least one empty hand to use Missile Party.','Interrupt (-5 Initiative)','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(65,'Motion Sense','Able to sense movement in her immediate vicinity, an adept with this power becomes a living motion sensor and is very difficult to sneak up on or ambush. Through a combination of natural and magical senses, the adept feels the movement of people, animals, or objects by their displacement of air molecules, changes in ambient barometric pressure, vibrations, or the minute disruption of the local mana field. This feeling alerts the adept to movement around her equal to (Magic) meters and can be used to detect living beings or objects that would otherwise be hidden by normal senses such as sight, sound, or smell. The size of the target also directly affects the adept’s ability to sense it.  To use this power, the adept must first make a Perception + Magic [Mental] test. The threshold for this test is based on the size of whatever the adept is attempting to sense; consult the Motion Sense table for results.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(66,'Mystic Armor','This power protects you from physical attacks. For every level, this power gives you 1 point of Armor (cumulative with other armor, but not adding to encumbrance) that also protects against damage you take in astral combat.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(67,'Natural Immunity','Add +1 die per level to your tests to resist toxins and disease.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(68,'Nerve Strike (SR5:SG)','By targeting various nerve clusters in his opponent’s body, an adept with this ability can disable or subdue on opponent without causing physical injury or death. To use this power, the adept must first declare his intention to employ it and then make a normal melee attack. If successful, the adept may choose to reduce his opponent’s Agility or Reaction (attacker’s choice) by 1 per net hit instead of inflicting Physical or Stun damage. If the targeted attribute reaches 0, the target is rendered paralyzed. An attacker must choose only one attribute to target per attack. The target regains lost attribute points with rest: 1 hour of rest recovers 1 lost point.  Nerve Strike works best on metahumans but can also be used against critters. A critter’s nerve clusters are more difficult to target, so two net hits are required to lower the targeted critter’s attribute by 1; all other normal rules apply. Targets without a functioning nervous system, such as spirits, drones, and so on, are unaffected by this power.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(69,'Nerve Strike (SR5:SSo)','This power allows an adept to inflict a paralyzing attack, temporarily crippling an opponent by targeting vital nerve clusters. The adept declares he is using the power and makes a normal unarmed melee attack. Instead of inflicting damage, each net hit reduces her opponent’s Agility or Reaction (attacker’s choice) by 1. If a character’s Agility or Reaction is reduced to 0, she is paralyzed and unable to move. Nerve Strike is most effective against metahuman opponents; when used against critters, reduce Agility or Reaction by 1 for every 2 net hits instead. Targets that lack a functional nervous system such as spirits and drones are immune to this power. Subjects that have lost Agility or Reaction in this manner must rest for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, they must make a Body + Willpower Test, with each hit returning 1 point of Agility or Reaction (character’s choice). The character makes another Body + Willpower Test each hour until all Agility and/or Reaction has been restored. Magical healing and First Aid may assist in speeding up this recovery.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSo'),(70,'Nimble Fingers (SR5:SG)','Adepts with this ability have exceptional manual dexterity. In game terms, this grants +1 die to Palming Tests, Performance Tests where the adept plays a musical instruments that requires the use of fingers, or any tests where small tools or items are used (gamemaster’s discretion). Additionally, the Simple Actions Change Gun Mode, Insert Clip, Remove Clip, and Use Simple Device are now considered Free Actions.','Intrinsic','',0.25,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(71,'Nimble Fingers (SR5:SSo)','The Nimble Fingers power allows the adept to perform simple reflex and timing tricks more efficiently and effectively. It adds a +1 dice pool modifier to Palming and other slight-of-hand tests involving manual dexterity. Additionally, Insert Clip, Pick Up/Put Down Object, Remove Clip, and Use Simple Object are considered Free Actions for the adept.','Intrinsic','',0.25,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSo'),(72,'Pain Relief','Similar to Nerve Strike but nicer, an adept channels mana into qi/chakra points to relieve tension, pain, and muscle fatigue. In game terms, this means removing the effects of Stun damage from a target. To use this power, the adept makes a Magic + Agility Test against a target. Every net hit temporarily removes one box of Stun damage from the target; normal rules for healing patients with implants still apply (p. 208, SR5). This effect only lasts for (Magic) hours or until the actual damage is healed, whichever comes first. The time necessary to complete the process is five minutes per box removed, and the adept must maintain contact with the target. Should the adept lose contact with the target for any reason before the process is complete, all benefits are immediately lost and the adept must repeat the process.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(73,'Pain Resistance','Pain resistance allows you to ignore the effects of injury (but not the actual damage). For every level of pain resistance, the wound modifiers on the Condition Monitor move one box farther down the chart, so that with 1 level of this power, you take the –1 penalty after 4 boxes of damage instead of 3. If you have 2 levels of the power, the penalty doesn’t kick in until you have 5 boxes of damage. Pain Resistance works equally on the Physical and Stun Condition Monitors. Pain Resistance also allows you to resist pain from torture, magic, illness, etc. Each level adds +2 dice to any test you make to withstand suffering.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(74,'Penetrating Strike','This ability allows an adept to focus and project an unarmed attack a short distance forward, bypassing armor the target may have or punching through their thick, stubborn hide. In essence, this gives the adept’s attack an AP rating equal to the levels she has in this power (maximum 4). This power can be used in conjunction with the Killing Hands power but not Elemental Strike.','Intrinsic','',0.25,4,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(75,'Piercing Senses','This power grants the adept an increased ability to identify illusions and related effects. The adept gains a +1 dice pool modifier to resist illusion-based effects for each level of this power.','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(76,'Plague Cloud','This power surrounds the adept in a dense cloud of fumes, insects, or other pollutants or toxins. All ranged attacks made while the power is active (either against or by the adept) are considered to be in at least Moderate Fog/Smoke (see Ranged Attack Modifiers, p. 173, SR5). If anyone makes a successful melee attack against an adept with this power is active, the attacker must resist the damage effects of pollution (see sidebar, p. 105).','Free Action','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(77,'Power Swimming','Adepts with this power are banned from Olympic events, as they swim with the grace and speed of a marine mammal. The adept’s swimming rate is doubled (p. 137, SR5), and each hit on a Swimming Test gains an additional 2 meters of distance, 4 meters for elves and trolls.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(78,'Precision Throwing','Adepts with this power go far beyond the limit of their physical form when it comes to getting their thrown weapons to strike their targets. For the purposes of determining Range only, treat the adept as having 2 additional Strength per level of this power.','Intrinsic','',0.25,3,'Constant',0,'SR5:HT'),(79,'Rapid Draw','No longer limited to pistols, the Rapid Draw power can be used by the adept to rapidly and more easily employ a variety of weapons in combat. Any weapon that is properly holstered can be quick-drawn; this includes blades, pistols, and throwing weapons. To use this ability, the adept makes a standard quick draw test (p. 165, SR5) but the threshold for this test is decreased by 1; this is cumulative with the use of a quick-draw holster. Also, with this power, a Quick Draw action is considered a Free Action.  For the purposes of this power, larger weapons such as SMGs, shotguns, or assault rifles attached to slings and/or held in front of the adept at the “low ready” position are also considered holstered and can be quickdrawn as such.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(80,'Rapid Healing','You recover from damage more quickly, magically healing yourself over periods of time. Add +1 die per level to your Body for Healing Tests. Also add +1 die per level to any tests made to heal you through magical or mundane means (such as a Heal spell or the First Aid skill), whether the attempt is made by you or another character.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(81,'Riposte','Similar to Counterstrike, Riposte is used during armed melee combat to redirect an attacker’s energy against them. To employ this power, an adept must first use a successful Parry action against an incoming attack and spend his next available action to make a melee combat attack. For the adept’s next melee combat attack test, add a number of dice equal to his levels in Riposte and the net hits from the Parry. Engaging in any other action before attacking, even Dodge or Full Defense, negates the bonuses gained from this power. Note: This power cannot be combined with the Riposte and Yielding Force Martial Arts techniques (p. 125 and 141, Run & Gun).','Interrupt (-5 Initiative)','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(82,'Rooting','Rooting allows an adept to become a nearly immovable object with a Simple Action. The power provides +1 to the adept’s Physical Limit for Knockdown (p. 194, SR5) only. It also provides a +1 dice pool modifier to any test resisting being knocked down, levitated, or otherwise being displaced against their will. The adept cannot move while the power is active, and she takes a –3 dice pool penalty to Dodge, Block or Parry tests while the power is active. The power can be canceled with a Free Action.','Simple Action','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp'),(83,'Skate','This power is a minor form of levitation that gives an adept the ability to run across a surface that she normally wouldn’t be able to, such as thin ice, a fragile structure, or water. The adept pushes off with her first step as she moves across the target surface before she stops. The distance an adept can traverse is equal to her Magic rating in meters. Attempting to traverse further distances requires the adept to find a stable surface or landing area to repeat the process; those who fail to find such a surface fall through whatever they are moving across. An adept attempting an acrobatic move or defensive Interrupt Action while using this power suffers a –3 dice pool penalty to her dice pool for the acrobatic or interrupt test.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(84,'Smashing Blow','Adepts with this power focus their magic into a single unarmed strike to break through obstacles. Multiply the adept’s base DV by 2 when attacking a barrier or other static structure. This applies to both physical and magical barriers.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(85,'Spell Resistance','You are inherently resistant to spells. Add +1 die per level to Resistance Tests against spells, spell rituals, alchemical preparations, or Innate Spell critter power (but not other critter powers). Spell Resistance does not interfere with spells that you choose not to resist.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(86,'Spirit Claw','Named by the Beast’s Way Sioux adept that discovered it, Spirit Claw allows the adept to temporarily create a small weapon of spiritual energy for use against spirits. While the discoverer’s manifestation of this power appeared as a set of oversized claws, others with this power have learned to form whatever weapon they desire—clubs, hammers, daggers, spikes, and so on—based on their particular Way or paradigm. Activated with a Free Action, Spirit Claw adds (Magic x 0.5) to the adept’s unarmed DV against spirits (regardless of whether the combat is physical or astral). It remains active for (Magic x 0.5) Combat Turns or when the adept deactivates it with a Free Action or strikes with it. To use Spirit Claw again, the energies must be re-channeled by spending another Free Action. Against spirits, this power can only be combined with the Killing Hands power.','Free Action','',0.25,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(87,'Spirit Ram','Similar to Spirit Claw, Spirit Ram creates a temporary, ram shape—horns, ram’s head, wedge, spikes, and so forth—in front of the adept for charge attacks against spirits in either physical or astral combat. The Reach of this weapon is (Magic x 0.5) meters, and its DV is (Magic) with AP – (Magic x 0.5). Spirit Ram moves with the adept and remains active for (Magic x 0.5) Combat Turns or when the adept deactivates it with a Free Action or strikes with it. To use Spirit Ram again, the energies must be re-channeled by spending another Simple Action.','Simple Action','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(88,'Stillness','This power allows an adept to exert control over her body to avoid detection. By slowing her physiological processes (heart rate, breathing, and the need to flex muscles) and entering a relaxed state, the adept becomes completely motionless for a specific amount of time. Her body’s heat signature is also lessened, making the adept harder to detect by thermographic means. For every level of this power, the adept can remain in this state for approximately one hour. Anyone using auditory or thermographic means to locate or perceive an adept using this power receives a negative penalty equal to the level of the adept’s power. Visual searches or Perception Tests are unaffected by this power. This power is negated as soon as the adept moves.','Intrinsic','',0.25,3,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(89,'Sustenance','Adepts with this power have exceptional metabolisms and can function with less food and water than normal. An average metahuman requires approximately three meals per day to maintain normal functions before fatigue damage begins. An adept with this power needs only one meal per day. In game terms, the intervals for hunger and thirst are increased to seven days for hunger and three days for thirst (p. 172, SR5).','Intrinsic','',0.25,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(90,'Temperature Tolerance','This power allows adepts to better withstand the effects of extreme temperatures. For every level in this power, the adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus for resisting damage caused by extreme temperature exposure (p. 172, SR5). This also can be used against magical effects such as elemental fire or cold (p. 170–171, SR5).','Intrinsic','',0.25,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(91,'Three-Dimensional Memory','Three-Dimensional Memory allows an adept to mentally record an area he has visited and then later recall it in ultra-clear detail. This ability is favored by adept investigators and recon specialists. To use this ability, the adept in question must use a Complex Action to view the targeted area in detail. This includes what he actually observed, but also any sensations he felt. The range of what the adept can observe is (Magic x Magic) cubic meters. He can record a number of areas equal to his Magic rating.  To recall what he recorded, the adept requires a Perception + Magic [Mental] test. What area he’s able to remember depends on what he was actually able to observe—for example, he wouldn’t know the contents of a closed cabinet but will remember the cabinet’s features in detail—and how long ago he observed the scene. To determine the threshold for the test, see the Three Dimensional Memory Table. If the threshold is reached, the adept can mentally walk through the scene and recall everything he mentally recorded; however, he will be unable to interact with anything in the scene.','Intrinsic','',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(92,'Toxic Strike','Toxic adepts with this power can channel either pollutants or radiation to an Unarmed Combat attack to cause extra elemental damage. The use of this ability follows the same rules and guidelines as the Elemental Strike power (p. 170). Each toxic elemental effect must be purchased as a separate power.','Simple Action','Killing Hands',0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SG'),(93,'Traceless Walk','You can move over surfaces—even snow, sand, or thin paper—without leaving visible traces. You make no noise through contact with the floor (though movement may still cause other sounds), and any hearing-based Perception Tests to detect you suffer a –4 dice pool penalty. You don’t trip ground-vibration or pressure sensors. You can’t walk across liquid surfaces—you’re magical, not miraculous—but you can walk across deep snow without sinking. While you can be tracked by non-visual cues such as scent, even those Track Tests are more difficult and get a –2 dice pool penalty.','Intrinsic','',1.00,1,'Constant',0,'Core'),(94,'Transmit Damage','This power allows an adept with Killing Hands to channel any physical damage he has taken into an unarmed attack and transmit it into his target. The attack is resolved using the standard rules for unarmed combat. For each box of unresisted physical damage the adept deals to his opponent, remove one box from his Physical Condition Monitor. The maximum number of boxes that can be transferred in this way is equal to the adept’s level in the power. Stun damage cannot be transmitted.','Intrinsic','',1.00,99,'Constant',0,'SR5:BB'),(95,'Voice Control','You get an amazing level of control over the properties of your voice. You can change your voice’s pitch, modulation and tone at will, as well as increase your volume. You can mask your voice and imitate sounds within the normal range of metahuman vocalization (no infrasound or ultrasound) and mimic the voices of others. If you use this trick to fool a person or a voice recognition system, make an Opposed Test using your Impersonation + Charisma [Mental] against the voice recognition system’s Rating x 2, or against the Perception + Intuition of characters the adept is attempting to fool, adding the level of this power as a bonus to your dice pool.  You can also adjust your voice to generate positive social effects, giving you +1 per level to your Social limit.','Intrinsic','',0.50,99,'Constant',0,'Core'),(96,'Wall Running','You can run up sheer walls or other vertical surfaces a limited distance. Make a Running + Strength [Magic] Test, with hits indicating the number of meters you may climb up in an action phase. If you want to run up longer distances, you’ll need steps, ledges, or somewhere you can stop and then use this power again. If you want to run across a vertical surface instead of up it, you can do so by combining this power with a Sprint action (p. 162). At the end of your movement, you fall off the wall, whether you made it as far as you wanted or not.','Simple Action','',0.50,1,'Single Action Phase',0,'Core'),(97,'Keratin Control','The adept has the ability to accelerate their hair, nail, and horn growth within the limits of the adept’s metatype. The adept can go from short, professional appearance to street chic in a matter of hours. The power also allows any hair grown to be straight or curly at the adept’s discretion. Full beards and long hair normally take six hours to grow, but the growth can be accelerated at the cost of one unresisted box of Stun Damage per hour reduction in growth time.','Free Action',NULL,0.50,1,'Constant',0,'SR5:SSp');

INSERT INTO `tcritterpower` VALUES (1,'Accident','Physical','Complex','LOS','Instant','Critter','Core','Critters with this power can cause seemingly normal accidents to occur. The exact nature of the accident is for the gamemaster to determine, based on what the target is doing and what’s going on around him. This power isn’t, in and of itself, dangerous, but circumstance and environment can come into play to make it so. Tripping on your own feet in front of rush-hour traffic could be hazardous to your health, for instance.  When a critter targets someone with this power, make an Opposed Test, using the critter’s Magic + Willpower against the target’s Reaction + Intuition. If the critter wins, treat it as if the target rolled a glitch on a test. If the critter scores 4 or more net hits, the accident is treated as a critical glitch—it’s not just an embarrassing fumble, it’s a potential catastrophe. A critter can use this power on a number of targets at once equal to its Magic rating.'),(2,'Animal Control','Mana','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','Some critters can manipulate other critters, particularly (but not always) mundane ones. This power lets the critters control the behavior of an animal or a group of animals. It has to be a normal behavior for the target animal. A flock of birds, for instance, couldn’t steal a motorcycle or fire a pistol, but they could attack someone, follow someone else, or simply be made to fly away. If the target critter leaves the controlling critter’s line of sight, it can’t be commanded any longer, but it will continue to follow any orders they had already been given for the critter’s Charisma in minutes. The critter may control a number of small animals (cats, rats, etc.) equal to its Charisma x 5, or a number of larger animals (wolves, lions, bears, etc.) equal to its Charisma. This power may not be used on any critter with the Sapience power.'),(3,'Armor','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','Whether it comes in the form of dermal bone deposits, scales, or just a thick hide, a critter with this power has some inherent protection from physical attacks. The critter’s natural Armor rating is cumulative with any armor worn.'),(4,'Astral Form','Mana','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','A critter with this power only exists in the astral plane. Only astral attacks or mana spells/powers may hurt an astral critter; physical attacks or spells/powers have no effect. The reverse is also true; an astral critter can only affect dual-natured beings or those on the astral plane, whether through astral projection or astral perception.Critters with this power may manifest on the physical plane in the same way as astrally projecting magicians (see p. 313).'),(5,'Binding','Physical','Complex','Special','Instant','Critter','Core','Whether it’s through webbing, a sticky tongue, or some magical force, the critter with this power can make its target stick to any surface the target happens to be touching (often, but not always, to the critter itself). The target may attempt to break free from this with a Complex Action, rolling Strength + Body against the critter’s Magic + Willpower. If the target prevails, he has escaped. If he fails, he remains immobilized until the next time he can attempt an escape. The range of this power depends on how the critter binds its targets; it may shoot webbing (Range: LOS), have a sticky body (Range: Touch), or just be good at sticking to things (Range: Self).'),(6,'Compulsion','Mana','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','This power enables the critter to compel a target to perform a specific action, even if that action might not be in the target’s best interests. The critter must make an Opposed Test using its Magic + Charisma against the target’s Willpower + Logic; if the target loses, he must immediately carry out the compelled action. The victim immediately recognizes that he was compelled to act after this power is used. This power can’t be used to plant suggestions for future compelled actions; once the power is dropped, the target’s mind is his own once again.'),(7,'Concealment','Physical','Simple','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','Critters with this power can mystically hide themselves, other people, or things that someone else is seeking. Concealment subtracts a number of dice equal to the critter’s Magic from any Perception Tests to locate the concealed subject.  Concealment can be used simultaneously on a number of metahuman-sized targets equal to the critter’s Magic, or a number of much smaller targets (cats, babies, rats, etc.) equal to the critter’s Magic x 5. Concealed subjects can see each other if the critter allows it. The effect lasts until the target is spotted or the critter stops sustaining the power.'),(8,'Confusion','Mana','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','This power renders the target unable to think clearly. He becomes indecisive, forgetful, and befuddled. The critter makes an Opposed Test using its Magic + Willpower against the target’s Willpower + Logic. Any net hits the critter scores become a negative dice pool modifier for any action the target character takes.'),(9,'Corrosive Spit','Physical','Complex','Special','Instant','Critter','Core','The critter’s saliva (or some other chemical it can shoot) is extremely caustic and can be used as a weapon. It’s treated as a standard ranged combat attack, using the critter’s Exotic Ranged Weapon skill + Agility [Physical], with range increments of (Body) meters. The spit causes Acid damage (p. 170), with a DV of (Magic x 2)P and an AP of –(critter’s Magic).'),(10,'Dragonspeech','Mana','Auto','LOS','Instant','Critter','Core','Draconic physiology is not capable of vocal speech. Dragons (and some other, possibly related, critters) are able to communicate telepathically with other beings through this power—as many as they like within line of sight—no matter what the beings’ own Language skills look like. This telepathic communication can’t be picked up by technological means, so dragons wishing to communicate with dragonspeech through modern technology must employ a metahuman as a “translator.” This power lets the critter project speech, but the target(s) cannot respond the same way without their own telepathic ability.'),(11,'Dual Natured','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','Dual-natured critters are active in both the astral plane and the physical plane at the same time. They can affect both astral and physical beings. They can perceive and interact with the astral plane like characters using astral perception (see Astral Perception, p. 312). Being dual natured, though, is different from astral perception in that a dual-natured critter always senses both the physical and astral worlds; they don’t have to shift back and forth (and, in fact, cannot do so). Their minds are accustomed to processing both astral and physical sensations, so dual-natured critters don’t suffer the –2 dice pool modifier for interacting with the physical world while astrally perceiving.'),(12,'Elemental Attack','Physical','Complex','Special','Instant','Critter','Core','Whether it’s a burst of flame or a bolt of lightning, a critter with this power can project a damaging stream of elemental energy. The power has a specific element type—for example, spirits of fire have Elemental Attack (Fire). The power is a ranged attack, with range increments of (Magic) meters, using the critter’s Exotic Ranged Weapon skill + Agility [Physical] to attack. The attack’s DV is (Magic x 2)P with an AP of –(critter’s Magic), plus as the appropriate elemental damage (p. 170), as listed in the critter’s statistics.'),(13,'Energy Aura','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','This critter is surrounded by a field of damaging energy, which can take the form of fire, electricity, cold, or the like. The power has a specific element type—for example, spirits of fire have Energy Aura (Fire). The critter adds its Magic to the Damage Value of any melee attack it makes. The damage may have a specific type and has an AP of –(critter’s Magic).  Successful melee attacks against a critter with Energy Aura also damage the attacker. The attacker makes a Damage Resistance Test against a DV equal to the critter’s Magic x 2. This attack has an AP of –(critter’s Magic). Unless indicated in the critter’s description, this power is always on and cannot be turned off.'),(14,'Engulf','Physical','Complex','Touch','Sustained','Critter','Core','This allows a critter to draw a target into itself or the terrain it controls, smothering or otherwise enveloping the target and causing damage. This is a melee attack. If it succeeds, it inflicts damage equal to its Magic x 2 (see below for specific effects by element), and the critter has engulfed its target in its grasp. Net hits on the melee attack increase this damage normally. The target gets a Damage Resistance Test as normal, using Body + Armor; the attack has an AP of –(critter’s Magic). Once engulfed, a target is trapped and cannot move.  Every time its Action Phase comes up after this, until the target escapes, the critter automatically inflicts damage as above; the target gets to resist each time as above. On the target’s Action Phase, he may use a Complex Action to try to escape. To attempt escape, make an Opposed Test, rolling the target’s Strength + Body against the critter’s Magic + Body. If the target wins, she escapes and takes no more damage from the attack.  Air Engulf\nThe victim resists Stun as if from an inhalation-vector toxin attack (p. 408). Armor does not protect against this attack, but other protective gear might (Toxin and Drug Protection Table, p. 408). If the victim passes out from Stun damage, she continues to take damage, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal.  Earth Engulf\nThe target resists Physical damage.  Fire Engulf\nThe victim resists Fire damage.  Water Engulf\nThe victim resists Stun damage. This is rougher than normal drowning, because the critter is capable of exerting great pressure on the victim. Victims who pass out from Stun damage continue to take damage after falling unconscious, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal.'),(15,'Enhanced Senses','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','This power includes any improved or augmented senses beyond the normal human range of awareness. This includes low-light and thermographic vision, improved hearing and smell, heat-sensing organs, natural sonar, and so on. The actual enhanced senses are specified it the critter’s description. If the enhanced sense doesn’t already have a specific effect (for example, thermographic vision), this power gives a +2 dice pool modifier to tests made using that enhanced sense, as well as +1 to the appropriate limit.'),(16,'Essence Drain','Physical','Complex','Touch','Permanent','Critter','Core','This power allows a critter to permanently take away another being’s Essence and add it to its own. Essence Drain can only target physical, sapient beings (characters and non-astral critters with the Sapience power). The target must be sapient (or achieve sapience) on its own; attempts to use spirit pacts or other methods to imbue mundane critters with Sapience solely for use as a source of Essence do not work.  Essence can’t be drained while the victim is actively, physically resisting. They must either be willing or subdued (restrained, paralyzed, mentally controlled, etc.). Essence transfer can only take place through a strong emotional connection, whether that emotion is passion, anger, or terror. The emotion must also be focused on the critter using the power. Abstract terror is not enough; the victim must be specifically terrified of his attacker in order for the attacker to drain the victim’s Essence. Though there is often a transfer of living material involved in an Essence Drain attack (a vampire drinking his victim’s blood, for instance), nothing but the emotional connection is actually required for this power to work.Draining a point of Essence takes an Extended Charisma + Magic (10 – target’s Essence, 1 minute) Test. If the critter is disturbed or interrupted before this test ends, the Essence point is not drained. Lost Essence affects a target character’s Magic or Resonance Rating (see Essence, p. 52). If a target character’s Essence is drained to 0, the character dies.  A critter can only increase its Essence to twice its natural maximum. Any Essence drained beyond this point is lost; the critter’s astral form can only hold so much at a time.  The psychic stimulus of the act of draining has the side effect of creating either agony or euphoria in the victim, depending upon the circumstances of the attack. Willing victims are most likely to feel a sensation of ecstasy, which could be addictive. A willing victim being drained must make a psychological Addiction Test (p. 413) with a threshold of 2.  A critter that drains Essence can pump their stolen life force into other attributes, including Magic, with a Simple Action. Every point of Essence spent may temporarily boost one Physical or Mental attribute, or Magic, by +1. Multiple points of Essence can be pumped into a single attribute if so desired, but only one point can be used per Simple Action. While more than one attribute may be boosted at a time (for example, Strength and Intuition can both be boosted at once), only one attribute may be so increased per Simple Action. The maximum boost an attribute can receive in this fashion is +4. This attribute boost wears off after 12 hours, and the Essence points used to fuel the boost are lost.'),(17,'Fear','Mana','Complex','LOS','Special','Critter','Core','This power gives a critter the power to fill its victims with overwhelming terror. The victim flees in panic and doesn’t stop until he is safely away and out of the critter’s sight. The critter makes an Opposed Test using its Willpower + Magic against the target’s Willpower + Logic. The terror lasts for 1 Combat Turn per net hit scored by the critter. Even once the fear fades, the target must succeed in a Willpower + Logic (critter’s net hits) Test to gather the nerve to face the critter again.'),(18,'Guard','Physical','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','This power allows the critter to protect against normal environmental accidents and hazards (both natural and those induced by the Accident power), such as preventing someone from succumbing to heatstroke or saving someone from drowning. The Guard power can also be used to prevent a glitch from occurring. Guard may be used on a number of characters at once equal to the critter’s Magic attribute. Each accident averted or glitch prevented counts as a service if this power is used by a spirit.'),(19,'Hardened Armor','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','There’s Armor, and then there’s Armor. This is the latter. This power provides its rating in Armor, and functions just like the Armor power. It differs from the Armor power as follows.  If the modified Damage Value of an attack is less than the Hardened Armor rating (modified by AP), the attack does no damage. Don’t make a Damage Resistance test for the critter; it might not even notice the attack was made in the first place.  If the modified Damage Value of an attack is greater than the Hardened Armor rating (modified by AP), then perform a Damage Resistance test for the critter as normal. Additionally, half of the Hardened Armor rating (modified by AP, rounded up) counts as automatic extra hits on this test.'),(20,'Hardened Mystic Armor','Mana','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','This power provides protection from attacks on the astral plane. Otherwise, it functions in the same way as Hardened Armor, above.'),(21,'Immunity','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','A critter with Immunity has an enhanced resistance to a certain type of attack or affliction. Effectively, the critter has a Hardened Armor rating equal to twice its Essence against that particular kind of damage (see Hardened Armor, p. 397). This means that if the modified Damage Value of the attack does not exceed the Immunity’s rating, then the attack automatically does no damage. If the modified DV exceeds the Immunity rating, perform a Damage Resistance test as normal, adding the Immunity rating to the dice pool for this test. Additionally, half (rounded up) of the Immunity rating counts as automatic hits on this test.  Some Immunities function slightly differently, because the attack they protect against doesn’t do damage, per se.  Immunity to Age: Some things don’t get old. Literally. Beings with this Immunity neither age nor suffer the effects of aging.  Immunity to Normal Weapons: This applies to all attacks that are not magical in nature; weapon foci, spells, and adept or critter powers function normally. If the critter also has the Allergy weakness, then the Immunity does not apply against non-magical attacks made using the allergen.'),(22,'Infection','Physical','Auto','Touc','Permanent','Critter','Core','This power is the vector by which the human-metahuman vampiric virus (HMHVV) is transmitted. When a critter with this power uses Essence Drain to reduce the victim’s Essence to 0, this power attempts to pass the critter’s own infection on to the victim. To see if the victim is infected, make an Opposed Test of the critter’s Magic + Charisma against the victim’s Body + Willpower. If the critter wins, the victim is infected and enters a coma-like state as the virus reshapes the victim physically, mentally, and spiritually. Twenty-four hours later, the victim rises as a new Infected critter (as determined by its original metaspecies) with a single point of Essence and an insatiable, bestial hunger for more. The new Infected critter must drain Essence from another being immediately.  Player characters transformed through the Infection power automatically become NPCs upon their “death” and are controlled by the gamemaster from that point forward.'),(23,'Influence','Mana','Complex','LOS','Instant','Critter','Core','This power gives the critter the ability to exert its own will on a target character. It implants a suggestion in the target’s mind. Make an Opposed Test using the critter’s Magic + Charisma against the target’s Willpower + Logic. If the critter succeeds, its target acts on the suggestion as if it was his own idea.  If the target is confronted with the wrongness of the suggestion, the subject can make a Willpower Test to overcome it, the same way that mental manipulation spells can be overcome (p. 292).'),(24,'Innate Spell','Mana','Complex','As spell','As spell','Critter','Core','This power allows the critter to instinctively cast a single, specific spell. To use this power effectively, the critter has to have the Spellcasting skill. Innate Spells are chosen from the list of spells cast by magicians, and magicians can oppose them with the Counterspelling skill as normal. Innate Spells also produce Drain as normal, and suffer a –2 penalty for sustaining. Critters and Spirits resist Drain with either Intuition or Charisma, at the gamemaster’s discretion.'),(25,'Materialization','Mana','Complex','Self','Sustained','Critter','Core','Magicians and many critters can leave their bodies and project themselves into the astral plane. Likewise, many astral critters can project themselves into the physical world and form a temporary “body” to inhabit while they’re here. This lets them interact with, and affect, physical beings. Additionally, they gain Immunity to Normal Weapons while materialized. Materializing and dematerializing to return to the astral plane both require a Complex Action.'),(26,'Mimicry','Physical','Simple','Self','Sustained','Critter','Core','This power allows a critter to exactly imitate sounds, including speech and the hunting calls of other creatures to which the mimicking critter has been exposed. If mimicking something from memory instead of recent exposure, the critter needs to roll a Memory Test (p. 152). Noticing that the mimicked sound is false requires a Perception Test; the threshold of this test is determined by the number of hits scored by the critter with a Charisma + Magic Test.'),(27,'Mist Form','Physical','Complex','Self','Sustained','Critter','Core','This power allows the critter to transform itself into a cloud of mist. Shifting into or out of mist form is a Complex Action. When shifting into mist form, the critter transforms itself and any bonded foci it is carrying, active or not.  The mist form has a movement rate of 5 meters per Combat Turn; the critter can control some of its movement in this form, though it is susceptible to strong winds. These can push or disrupt the mist, which can temporarily disorient the critter. The mist form can pass through any cracks or crevices that aren’t airtight. Systems that defend against gases, bacteria, or viral infiltration also stop a critter in mist form.  While in mist form, the critter has Immunity to Normal Weapons. If the being is exposed to a substance to which it is allergic, it is immediately forced back into its normal form. While in mist form, the critter can perceive normally but cannot use any of its other powers until it resumes its normal form.'),(28,'Movement','Physical','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','This power allows the critter to speed up or slow down the target’s movement rate. The power only works on things that are predisposed to locomotion: vehicles, characters, or critters. If used on targets other than the critter, it also only functions in terrain that the critter controls. If used only on the critter itself, this power can be used anywhere. The critter can multiply or divide the target’s movement rate by up to its Magic attribute.  Only one instance of this power may be applied to a particular target at any one time. Once the target has left the critter’s terrain/domain, the power ends and the target’s movement is returned to normal.  Using Movement on vehicles is tougher than it is on critters and characters. If the target is a vehicle, the critter makes a Magic + Willpower test with a threshold of half the vehicle’s Body (round up), with a minimum of 2. If the critter meets the threshold in this test, multiply the hits by the vehicle’s Acceleration Rating and add the result to (or subtract it from) the vehicle’s Speed in the next Combat Turn, as if making an Acceleration or Deceleration Test. The critter can continue to make Magic + Willpower Tests to increase or decrease the vehicle’s speed each Combat Turn that it sustains this power and the vehicle remains in its domain/terrain. Based on the situation, these sudden changes in speed may call for Crash Tests (p. 201) for the vehicle'),(29,'Mystic Armor','Mana','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','This power functions in the same way as Armor, except that it only provides protection from attacks on the astral plane.'),(30,'Natural Weapon','Physical','Auto','Touch','Instant','Critter','Core','Claws. Sharp, pointy teeth. A spiked tail. Whatever form it takes, the critter possesses some means of inflicting Physical damage. The description of this power describes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage Value and Armor Penetration modifiers where applicable. Natural weapons may be either melee or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Unarmed Combat skill to attack with natural melee weapons, and the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to attack with natural ranged weapons. Most natural weapons are considered normal weapons for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in individual critter descriptions.  A dual-natured critter with a melee Natural Weapon can use this power against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter’s normal Unarmed Combat skill and physical Damage Value for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat, do not work on the astral plane.  Critters without a Natural Weapon may still make an unarmed attack. As with regular characters, the Damage Value is (STR)S.'),(31,'Noxious Breath','Physical','Complex','Special','Instant','Critter','Core','A lot of critters have bad breath—this one’s breath is actually toxic. The critter with this power can incapacitate targets with a nauseating stench. This is treated as a ranged attack using the critter’s Exotic Ranged Weapon skill + Agility [Physical]. The damage is a toxin attack with an inhalation vector (Speed: Immediate, Power: critter’s Magic, Effect: Stun damage, nausea; see p. 409). Armor is useless, but respiratory protection will help guard the target (see the Toxin and Drug Protection Table, p. 408).  This blast of breath extends in a cone out to (Body) meters and can catch up to two targets who are within one meter of each other.'),(32,'Paralyzing Howl','Physical','Complex','Special','Special','Critter','Core','This power affects everyone who hears it, be they friend or foe, within a radius of (Magic x 15) meters. The critter makes an Opposed Test using its Magic + Charisma against the target’s Intuition + Willpower. The rating of any area-effect sound-dampening devices, personal sound-dampening devices (such as cyberware), or hits scored by Hush or Silence spells, is added to the target’s Opposed Test. If the target wins, he suffers no ill effects.  If the critter wins, the target’s Reaction and Agility are both reduced by 1 for every net hit the creature scores; the reduction in Reaction affects the target’s Initiative and Initiative Score. This effect lasts for (Magic + net hits) Combat Turns. If either Agility or Reaction drop to zero, the target is paralyzed for (Magic + net hits) minutes and can take no actions except to breathe. After either effect ends, the target’s Reaction and Agility each return at the rate of 1 point per minute.'),(33,'Paralyzing Touch','Physical','Complex','Touch','Special','Critter','Core','This is the Touch-range version of the Paralyzing Howl power. The critter must touch the target; if the target is surprised or otherwise unaware of the critter, this is automatic. If the target is aware of the critter, treat this as a Melee Attack that causes no damage. The Opposed Test to paralyze a target is the critter’s Magic + Agility against the target’s Intuition + Willpower. Otherwise, this power functions the same way as Paralyzing Howl.'),(34,'Petrification','Physical','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','Some critters petrify you with fear. Critters with this power can do it literally. Perform an Opposed Test using the critter’s Magic + Willpower against the target’s Intuition + Willpower. If the target wins, he suffers no ill effects.  If the critter wins, the target’s Agility and Reaction are both reduced by 1 for each net hit the critter scores; this reduction also affects the target’s Initiative and Initiative Score. This effect lasts as long as the critter sustains the power. After this effect ends, the target’s Reaction and Agility return at the rate of 1 point each per minute.  If either Agility or Reaction drop to 0, the target is transformed into a stone statue. He remains a statue for as long as the critter sustains the power; once the power is dropped, the target resumes his normal state and regains Reaction and Agility each at the rate of 1 per minute.  While transformed, the victim is unaware of his surroundings and events happening around him. He has a Barrier Rating equal to the critter’s Magic x 2.'),(35,'Psychokinesis','Physical','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','This power enables a critter to move an object with his mind. It’s similar to the Magic Fingers spell (p. 294), acting as a magical “hand” with Strength and Agility equal to the number of hits scored on a Magic + Willpower Test.'),(36,'Regeneration','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','This power allows rapid healing of any damage a critter has taken. At the end of each Combat Turn, if the critter has any damage on either of its Condition Monitors, it makes a Magic + Body Test, adds its Body to the number of hits scored, and heals that many boxes of damage, first from Physical overflow, then from the Physical damage monitor, and finally from the Stun damage monitor. If the critter has exceeded its Physical overflow damage, it’s not dead yet. It still gets a Regeneration Test. If, after this test, its Physical overflow still exceeds its Body, then it’s really dead.  Regeneration can’t heal everything. Damage to the brain or spinal cord (for example, a called shot to the head) can’t be healed this way. Magical damage from weapon foci, combat spells, most critter or adept powers, or Drain likewise can’t be healed by Regeneration. If the critter is damaged by something it has an Allergy to, it can heal that damage with Regeneration, but can’t make the Regeneration Test as long as it’s in contact with the allergen.  Regeneration is incompatible with augmentations. Critters with Regeneration cannot receive augmentations; surgical incisions close too quickly to perform the implantation. Critters with augmentations who gain this power will reject their augmentations as the power repairs the existing genetic template.'),(37,'Sapience','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','Critter','Core','Sapient critters are self-aware, capable of making their own choices, and are generally at or above the level of Homo sapiens. While most critters are considered Unaware of any skill they don’t possess, sapient critters are merely Untrained and can default normally. They are also capable of learning new skills if they so choose.  Most sapient critters are mundane, but they are capable of Awakening and possessing a Magic attribute. Awakened sapient critters are capable of learning any magical task they set their minds to, and follow the same rules for magic as normal characters. While no sapient critters are known to have Emerged as technomancers, the appearance of “technocritters” has led many scientists to believe that it’s only a matter of time—if it hasn’t already happened.'),(38,'Search','Physical','Complex','Special','Special','Critter','Core','Seek, and ye shall find, but it goes a lot faster with this power. To find a target, the critter makes a Magic + Intuition (5, 10 minutes) Extended Test. Lots of things can make this harder; apply the appropriate modifiers from the Search Modifiers Table.  The critter must have seen the thing it’s searching for at some time before the search begins. Spirits may search for anything for which their summoner can provide them a mental image. Critters who can enter astral space may use this power there and do not have to materialize while searching, even if the target is in the physical world.  '),(39,'Venom','Physical','Auto','Touc','Instant','Critter','Core','The critter secretes a toxin (see p. 408) that is dangerous and harmful to others. Typically, the attributes for this poison are Vector: Injection, Speed: 1 Combat Turn, Penetration: 0, Power: Magic, Effect: Physical damage. Some critters may have venoms with different attributes—these will be noted in their individual descriptions.'),(40,'Weather Control','Physical','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Critter','Core','This allows a critter to manipulate, within reason, certain local weather conditions. The desired weather must be realistically possible in the environment, which means no snow storms in equatorial Africa, for instance. It builds up over time, reaching its peak when the critter completes a Magic + Willpower (10, 30 minutes) Extended Test. In spite of the power’s name, the critter doesn’t actually control the weather; it only summons it and pushes it in the desired direction. A critter can summon a thunderstorm, for instance, but can’t aim the lightning bolts.'),(41,'Anaphylaxis','Physical','Complex','Touch','Instant','Spirit','SR5:SG','Anaphylaxis is a massive systemic reaction induced by a concentrated burst of pollutants from a toxic spirit. Treat this as a toxin attack with the following ratings:'),(42,'Astral Gateway','Mana','Complex','LOS (A)','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','The spirit can open an astral rift (p. 28), which forces all nearby objects to become dual-natured and allows even mundanes to astrally project. An astral rift can open to any metaplane the spirit can visit.'),(43,'Aura Masking','Mana','Free','Self','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','Sometimes a spir it doesn’ t want someone to assense its natural aura. This power functions like Masking (p. 326, SR5) and Extended Masking metamagics.  Use the spir it’s Edge in place of its initiate grade. The spir it can also hide its own use of powers on itself within the mask; only a magician who pierces this mask can see the spir it using such powers. A spir it can mask itself to look like another astral being, but it cannot tr y to pass itself of f as a mundane being unless it is attached to a physical body or has the Realistic Form power (p. 198).'),(44,'Banishing Resistance','Mana','Auto','Self','Special','Spirit','SR5:SG','When resisting a Banishing attempt (p. 301, SR5), treat the spirit as if it owes a number of services equal to its Edge; these refresh every sunrise and sunset and are cumulative with any services the spirit may actually owe a conjurer.'),(45,'Desire Reflection','Mana','Complex','LOS','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','Desire Reflection finds the greatest desire of a single target within line of sight and evokes a full-sensory illusion keyed to the desire in the target’s mind. Certain spirits use this power to draw in potential victims. The spirit itself can appear as a harmless or pleasing aspect of the illusion at will. To use this power the critter must succeed in an Opposed Test pitting its Magic + Intuition against the target’s Willpower + Intuition. If it scores any net hits, the victim falls for the illusion. Otherwise the power fails to affect the victim.  Left to their own devices, victims act as if their desire were real and right in front of them. If the victim is attacked, injured, slapped, and so on, he may make another Opposed Test to resist the illusion; if the attack or what have you comes directly from a component of the illusion, add +2 to the dice pool. Each hit reduces the spirit’s net hits on the original Opposed Test. If the spirit’s net hits are reduced to 0, the victim breaks free of the illusion. Those who fail are lost and entranced, caught up in the fulfillment of their desire.'),(46,'Deathly Aura','Physical','Simple','Special','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','The spirit radiates an aura of fear and decay, which taints the surrounding environment. For an area with a radius of (Force) meters around the spir it, the temperature drops by (Force x 2)°C. Also, organic mater ial in this radius decays at a faster rate, aging by a factor equal to the spir it’s Force. This ef fect is not fast enough to noticeably damage metahumans and other large cr itters, but the aura withers plants and kills small creatures such as insects or mice. This aura fills living creatures with unreasoning terror. Someone who wishes to voluntar ily enter an af fected area must succeed in an Opposed Test between their Char isma + Willpower and the spir it’s Force x 2 or else they are compelled to flee until they are out of sight of whatever caused the aura.'),(47,'Devouring','Physical','Complex','Touch','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','Insect spirits use the Devouring power to consume all biomaterial (e.g., crops, wood, vegetation) and most non-living objects. Some flesh-form and hybrid-form spirits seem to derive sustenance from this consumption, whereas others regurgitate the material for constructing parts of their hive. The spirit makes an Opposed Test, using the spirit’s Force x 2 against the Object Resistance (p. 295, SR5) of all possible materials/objects within (Magic) meters (to save time, the gamemaster may choose to roll once for the spirit and then roll Object Resistance for each object or object type). If the spirit gets any net hits against a particular object, that object is devoured. While this power is sustained, barriers lose 1 point of Structure Rating and vehicles take 1 box of damage per Combat Turn. Living critters and characters are unaffected.'),(48,'Divining','Mana','Special','Special','Special','Spirit','SR5:SG','This power functions like the Divination metamagic (p. 147), except the spirit uses Magic + Intuition to divine meaning instead of Arcana + Logic.'),(49,'Elemental Attack (pollutant)','Physical','Complex','Special','Instant','Spirit','SR5:SG','This attack follows the rules for Elemental Attack (p. 396, SR5) but with the following modifications.  Pollutants can take many forms, including biological waste, industrial runoff, biohazardous materials, and so on. Pollutant attacks have a DV of (Magic x 2)S with an AP of –(critter’s Magic). Additionally, once the pollutant has worked its way into the character’s system (that is, after the interval determined by the toxin’s Speed), he must resist a toxin with the following stats:'),(50,'Elemental Attack (radiation)','Physical','Complex','Special','Instant','Spirit','SR5:SG','This attack follows the rules for Elemental Attack (p. 396, SR5) but causes radiation elemental damage, which results in radiation burns, radiation poisoning, and other serious side effects.  Radiation damage is treated as Physical damage and ignores Armor; however, the affected character may add the rating of a hazmat suit or other radiation-resistant gear when making a Damage Resistance Test against radiation damage. Radiation poisoning may also cause nausea (p. 409, SR5), headaches, blindness, or other central nervous system impairments (per gamemaster’s discretion).'),(51,'Endowment','Mana','Complex','Touch','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','The spirit grants the use of one of its powers to the target. The spirit may still use the power while the target uses it, and the spirit can grant a power to a number of targets equal to its Magic. No character may gain more than one power from a spirit at a time.'),(52,'Energy Drain','Mana','Complex','Touch or LOS','Permanent','Spirit','SR5:SG','The Energy Drain power is used by a number of dangerous critters and spirits in different ways. Each version of this power is slightly different, depending on the entity using it. Similar to the Essence Drain power (p. 396, SR5), Energy Drain allows the creature to suck life energy from a victim, be it Karma, Force, Magic, or Essence. For some creatures, such as blood spirits, shedim, or insect spirits, this power is Touch range, so a resisting victim must be subdued first or drained unwittingly. Other beings, such as shadow spirits, merely require line of sight for this power, allowing the critter to feed off its victims from afar.  Draining a point of Karma, Force, Magic, or Essence requires a Willpower + Magic [Mental] (10 – target’s Essence/Force, 1 minute) Extended Test. If the critter is disturbed or interrupted before this test ends, the point is not drained. If the Extended Test is completed, the critter drains one point of the specified energy, adding to its own or converting the energy to an appropriate rating point at a 1:1 ratio. Some critters, such as astral bacteria or insect spirits, use the drained energy to reproduce, as noted in their individual descriptions. Drained points are permanently lost.  In addition to the drain, victims suffer 1 box of damage for each point drained. Depending on the critter, this may be Stun damage (shadow spirits, astral bacteria) or Physical damage (blood spirits, shedim). Victims who take Physical damage appear drained, withered, and hollow, and are sometimes marked permanently (white hair, hair loss, wrinkles, premature aging, or other strange markings).  If a character’s Magic is reduced to 0, he burns out and becomes mundane. If a critter’s Magic is reduced to 0, it dies. If a spirit, sustained/anchored/quickened spell, focus, or mana barrier’s Force is reduced to 0, it is destroyed. If a victim’s Essence is reduced to 0, they die.'),(53,'Hive Mind','Mana','Auto','Special','Always','Spirit','SR5:SG','All insect spirits of a given species controlled by a shaman or a queen/mother possess a constant telepathic bond with one another. Insect spirits may send a telepathic message to one or more spirits in the hive and/or the shaman as a Free Action. The shaman or queen/mother can also use this link to experience any of the hive’s insect spirits (or switch to another spirit) with a Simple Action, similar to the Sense Link power (p. 198) but without range limitations.  The constant buzz of insect spirits in an insect shaman’s mind can be distracting, especially if the hive is agitated. When this occurs, the shaman must succeed in a Magic + Willpower [Mental] (2) Test in order to suppress the background hum and concentrate on something, such as fighting or spellcasting.'),(54,'Inhabitation','Physical','Auto','Self','Special','Spirit','SR5:SG','Most spirits can only affect the physical world by materializing or possessing a vessel. A spirit with Inhabitation exists on the physical plane continuously after it has merged with a prepared vessel. The spirit cannot be separated with Banishing, and the spirit cannot voluntarily leave the vessel. An inhabiting spirit is only disrupted when its vessel is either destroyed or killed from Physical damage overflow (p. 209, SR5). If the inhabited vessel is living, the spirit gains complete control of the body and access to some or all of the vessel’s memories. During merging, the vessel’s original spirit is consumed (if present) and that character is lost (though gamemasters may decide otherwise, if appropriate to their stories).  To inhabit a vessel, a spirit requires a prepared vessel (p. 135) in a magical lodge with a Force at least equal to the spirit’s Force. Once the vessel has been enchanted, the spirit may use Inhabitation on it. The Inhabitation process takes a number of days equal to the spirit’s Force. At the end of that period, the spirit makes an Opposed Test using its Force x 2 against the vessel’s Willpower + Intuition. The spirit’s conjurer (if any) may influence the result by adding his Binding skill to either dice pool. If the spirit is attempting to inhabit a nonliving vessel, the spirit rolls Force x 2 against the vessel’s Object Resistance dice pool (p. 295, SR5). The number of net hits determines the resulting form. If the spirit gets a critical glitch, the merge is unsuccessful, and the vessel is immune to further inhabitation attempts by that spirit.   The Inhabitation process is trying for both spirit and vessel. If the vessel is removed from the magical lodge before the merge is complete, the spirit and host generally die (though the gamemaster is entitled to make exceptions for hosts). At the end of the inhabitation period, the spirit takes full control over the host; the type of form depends on the Opposed Test results, as follows:'),(55,'Magical Guard','Mana','Free','LOS','Instant','Spirit','SR5:SG','A critter with the Magical Guard power can use the Counterspelling skill and provide spell defense and dispel spells the same as a magician’s ability (p. 294, SR5).'),(56,'Mind Link','Mana','Simple','LOS','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','A critter with the Mind Link power can open and maintain telepathic communication with another sapient creature. The spirit can maintain a number of simultaneous mental links equal to its Magic attribute. If multiple sapients are engaged via Mind Link with the same spirit, they may communicate freely with each other as well as with the original spirit.'),(57,'Mutagen','Physical','Complex','Self','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','A being can use the Mutagen power to magically enhance its physical body at the expense of its mental abilities. While using the power, it can shift a maximum of (Magic) attribute points from Mental to Physical attributes. This power can be used by possessing spirits, shifting Mental attribute points from the spirit to the vessel’s Physical attributes. Shifting in or out of mutated form requires a Complex Action. Instead of shifting attribute points, a gamemaster may choose to use this power to generate a new physical feature, like a tail, claw, or new eye.'),(58,'Pestilence','Physical','Auto','Touch','Instant','Spirit','SR5:SG','The critter carries non-magical, contagious infection that may infect characters that come in contact with it (or its secretions). Treat this disease as a toxin (p. 408, SR5) with the following attributes:'),(59,'Possession','Physical','Complex','Touch','Special','Spirit','SR5:SG','Some spirits are incapable of materializing, so they must possess vessels in order to interact with meat space. During a possession attempt, the spirit uses the vessel’s aura as a temporary conduit to the physical plane. The spirit makes an Opposed Test by rolling its Force x 2 against the vessel’s Intuition + Willpower for living vessels or the Object Resistance dice pool of an inanimate vessel. A prepared vessel (p. 135) gives the spirit a +6 dice pool modifier. If the spirit fails, it is forced back to the astral plane. If the spirit succeeds, both spirit and vessel are considered a single dual-natured entity (p. 395, SR5) for the possession’s duration.  A possessing spirit may be forced back to the astral plane with a Banishing Test (p. 301, SR5). If the possession attempt fails or the spirit is banished, that spirit cannot attempt to possess that vessel again until the next sunrise or sunset.'),(60,'Quake','Physical','Complex','Special','Instant','Spirit','SR5:SG','The spirit can create earthquakes with potentially devastating effects. The quake affects an area with a radius of (Force) kilometers, and the shaking persists intermittently for (Force) minutes. Areas especially vulnerable to earthquakes are usually not areas that receive them frequently, as people in vulnerable areas tend to build dwellings with earthquakes in mind. The spirit makes a Magic + Willpower Test and the number of hits represents the magnitude of the quake, as noted on the Quake Table.  While the effects of an individual quake are highly dependent upon the conditions of surrounding soil, the quality of engineering, and the preparedness of the surrounding citizenry, the following guidelines can be used (generally, a quake includes the effects on the line for its number of hits as well as all the other effects for a smaller number of hits):'),(61,'Realistic Form','Physical','Auto','Self','Special','Spirit','SR5:SG','A spirit with Realistic Form can be mistaken for a normal physical creature or object when it materializes, or it appears unremarkable when joined to a vessel. A spirit that appears as a metahuman would have a heartbeat and a regular breathing rate. A spirit that appeared as an object mimics the object’s normal functionality; for example, a toaster could be plugged into the wall to toast bread (though it would have no Matrix link, making it an antique toaster). The spirit is in no way disguised from the astral plane, but to physical observation appears to any senses to be a natural part of the physical world.  Note that spir its with the Mater ialization power normally only have one mater ialized form. Mater ializing spir its with this power can choose to appear using Realistic Form or their normal mater ialized form. A fire elemental can still appear as a column of angr y flames but might also be able to appear as a beautiful woman.'),(62,'Reinforcement','Physical','Complex','Touch','Special','Spirit','SR5:SG','This power strengthens the resistance of natural and constructed materials. To fortify materials, the spirit must take a Force x 2 [Force] (square meters, 1 hour) Extended Text. If successful, the spirit’s Force is added to the Structure and Armor Ratings. Multiple applications of Reinforcement are not cumulative, and only the highest effect counts.'),(63,'Sense Link','Mana','Simple','Special','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','A critter with the Sense Link power can share sensory data with its summoner (and vice versa). The summoner experiences the critter’s emotions (at a low level) and can send simple commands, which the critter may not understand or follow, especially if the command places them in danger. An Intuition + Charisma Test, opposed by the critter’s Willpower + Intuition, may be used to persuade the critter to obey. In addition, the summoner can experience one of the critter’s senses with a Simple Action; with each Simple Action expended, the summoner can choose which sense to experience. Augmented senses (whether they are magically augmented or otherwise) in the summoner do not work through the critter. The range of this power is equal to (Magic x 50 meters). If the critter is hurt while the link is intact, the summoner must resist Stun damage equal to the damage inflicted on the critter with a Willpower + Magic Test.'),(64,'Shadow Cloak','Physical','Free','Self','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','This power allows a creature to envelop itself in utter darkness, making it appear to be a shadow. Shadow Cloak is useless in full daylight and unnecessary in complete darkness; other lighting conditions make it difficult to see the creature using this power. Apply a –2 dice pool modifier to Perception Tests for detecting the creature in Normal Light, –4 dice pool modifier in Partial Light, and a +1 dice pool modifier in Glare conditions.'),(65,'Silence','Physical','Complex','Special','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','A creature with this power can surround itself in a sphere of silence with a radius equal to the creature’s Magic in meters. Sounds from within the area are muffled, and sounds entering the area are harder to hear by the creature or anyone else. Sound-based Perception Tests and the Damage Value of sound-based attacks are reduced by the spirit’s Magic.'),(66,'Sonic Projection','Physical','Complex','Special','Sustained','Spirit','SR5:SG','This power affects everyone within earshot—except for spirits of the same type—and creates a deafening and distracting buzz. The spirit makes an Opposed Test using its Force x 2 against each target’s Willpower. Sound dampers and spells like Hush/Silence provide additional dice to the defender equal to their Rating or the hits the caster scored. Each of the spirit’s net hits provides a negative dice pool modifier on all tests for as long as the buzzing is sustained.'),(67,'Storm','Physical','Complex','Special','Special','FreeSpirit','SR5:SG','A spirit with this power can send a massive, destructive elemental storm against a targeted area. Icy rain, bolts of lightning, gale-force winds, and more strike the area. The affected area’s radius equals the spirit’s Magic x 100 meters. The spirit makes a single Unarmed Combat + Magic [Force] Test, and all characters, creatures, and objects in the area are considered subject to Suppressive Fire (p. 179, SR5). The storm’s base Damage Value is (Force)P.'),(68,'Astral Projection','Mana','Complex','Self','Special','FreeSpirit','SR5:SG','The spirit can astrally project, just like a magician (p. 313, SR5). This power is only available to spirits with the Inhabitation power. A spirit that does not return to its body after (Force x 2) hours is disrupted.'),(69,'Mutable Form','Physical','Auto','Self','Special','FreeSpirit','SR5:SG','Spirits normally materialize with the same form every time, but Mutable Form allows the spirit to appear differently each time. The spirit’s aura is unchanged, however. If the spirit also has the Realistic Form power (p. 198), add the spirit’s Force to any Disguise Tests (p. 133, 136, SR5) it makes to impersonate someone. This power is only available to spirits with Materialization.'),(70,'Personal Domain','Mana','Auto','LOS','Sustained','FreeSpirit','SR5:SG','The spirit leaves its personal mark over an area of astral space, up to 10,000 square meters per point of Force. Over time this area accumulates a background count aspected toward the tradition the spirit represents (p. 30). The gamemaster determines how quickly the background accumulates, but the process should take months or longer, and the background count should not exceed the spirit’s Force / 2.'),(71,'Regeneration','Physical','Auto','Self','Always','FreeSpirit','SR5:SG','Similar to the critter power of Regeneration (p. 400, SR5), this power only applies to the spirit’s materialized, possessed, or inhabited form. If the spirit possesses or inhabits a formerly living vessel, the vessel slowly regenerates back to its living form. For example, a wooden homunculus begins to grow new leaves, and a corpse regains a semblance of life.'),(72,'Spirit Pact','Mana','Special','Special','Special','FreeSpirit','SR5:SG','A spirit with this power can enter into one or more spirit pacts (p. 137). The gamemaster has the final say on what pacts a spirit can enter into. For rules about conducting a spirit pact, see Spirit Pact (Contractual), p. 136.'),(73,'Hidden Life','Physical','Complex','Touch','Permanent','GreaterSpirit','SR5:SG','The spirit uses this power to permanently place its life force in a creature, place, or object. As long as the hiding place remains safe, the spirit cannot be permanently banished or destroyed by any means. The spirit is able to return after a year and a day if banished with its spirit formula, but a character holding the spirit formula may call the spirit sooner.  The hiding place gains Immunity to Normal Weapons with a Magic equal to the spirit’s and Immunity to Age (p. 397, SR5). If the hidden life holder is destroyed, the life force returns to the spirit, and the spirit is treated normally.'),(74,'Energy Drain (karma)','Mana','','','','GreaterSpirit','SR5:SG',''),(75,'Vessel Trading','Physical','Complex','Touch','Instant','GreaterSpirit','SR5:SG','A spirit with Possession may choose to evict the life force of a living vessel, either by ejecting the victim’s life force as an astrally projecting creature or putting the victim’s life force in the spirit’s old vessel. If the old vessel already contains a life force that was subdued by Possession, the victim is forced to astrally project instead. Follow the standard rules for the Possession power (p. 197). Victims placed into a living or nonliving vessel cannot control the vessel like a possessing spirit and are trapped there. The only possible methods of escape is if a free spirit with this power switches them back, the victim can astrally project, or the vessel is exposed to an astral rift or an entity with the Astral Gateway power (p. 194). A victim trapped in an inanimate vessel or astral space will feel his life force ebbing away, and he will die after (Magic or Essence) x 2 hours.'),(76,'Wealth','Physical','Complex','LOS','Special','GreaterSpirit','SR5:SG','A spirit with this power can generate precious metals, jewels, and other rare items of great value. Where these items come from is a question no spirit has answered. Once per month, the spirit may make a Magic + Edge [Force] Test. Every hit generates 10,000 nuyen worth of mineral alchemical reagents, usually precious metals or gems. These permanent creations indefinitely carry the spirit’s astral signature. The markets being what they are, characters may find it difficult to sell magical gems.A spirit with this power may also create a similar amount of temporary wealth each day, but the next time the suns sets or rises, these valuable items vanish or transform into dirt or other worthless substances. Because of this, savvy businessmen are reluctant to purchase magical gold.');

Even more unusual placements have been dreamed up. Each gland can only produce a single compound, chosen when purchased, and the selection cannot be changed.

Several stars have denied using this upgrade, only to be scandalized when the truth is uncovered. Indeed, one star, Adrianna Vente, who had a staggering natural range, was driven into ruin based on fabricated proof backing the accusation that her voice had been modified. In addition to the core enhancement, a second, more expansive version exists. While the base enhancement gives the user access to a full eight octaves for singing, the vocal range expander pushes the boundaries even further, allowing the user’s voice to reach into the infrasonic and ultrasonic, ranging from 20 Hz to 200 kHz, producing sounds beyond the standard metahuman hearing range. Combined with a similar hearing enhancement, users can speak with one another at a frequency others can’t hear, an obvious advantage. If the user is a skilled mimic, they can further replicate a wider array of sounds than an ordinary metahuman is capable of. The vocal range enhancer raises the user’s Social limit by 1 for any test where they speak, or by 2 for any Perform (Singing) test.

It’s ideal for penetrating confined areas, and its gecko-tipped extremities and light weight render it capable of crawling on walls and ceilings; it is, however, quite fragile, and merely being stepped on or a tag eraser can easily destroy it. This drone is operated with the Pilot Walker skill.','Core',''),(2,'Micro','Hovercraft','Disc','Silkorsky-Bell Microskimmer','3','3','1','0',0,3,3,'6','1,000¥','Quiet and durable, this disc-shaped skimmer is smaller than a frisbee and can even skim over water. It moves with small and rather weak hoverjets. It is easier to spot than the Kanmushi, but still very small. It is operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill; the hovercraft specialization applies.','Core',''),(3,'Micro',NULL,NULL,'Goldfish','2/4','1W','1','0',0,2,2,'6','500¥','Sized to realistic proportions and capable of dives of up to four meters deep, the Renraku Goldfish is a prime example of an entry-level water drone, suitable as a trainer for youths who look toward a future as robotic operators or hobbyists who wish to explore local watering holes below the surface.','SR5:R5.0','Submersible'),(4,'Micro',NULL,NULL,'NoizQuito','4','3R','2','1',0,3,3,'10R','2,000¥','The NoizQuito was developed as a flying micro drone with a few special tricks. Visually similar to a mosquito, the body of the drone can only house a small number of features. The most prevalent and obvious of these features is the speaker system. The drone can blast sounds as loud as 160 decibels (which is the volume of high-end race cars), which are used to produce distractions and possibly even minor ear damage in those unfortunate enough to be near the drone when it activates. Additionally, the drone’s wings and body are covered in small LEDs that are powerful enough to produce blinding levels of light in a bewildering array of strobe patterns.','SR5:R5.0','Flying, speakers, strobes'),(5,'Mini','Aircraft','Insectoid','MCT Fly-Spy','4','3','2','1',0,3,3,'8','2,000¥','This Mitsuhama drone is the size and shape of a large insect but can achieve substantially better altitudes.

This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.','Core',''),(6,'Mini','Aircraft','Sphere','Horizon Flying Eye','4','3','2','1',0,3,3,'8','2,000¥','This spherical flying drone uses omnidirectional thrust nozzles to stay airborne. Just about eyeball-sized, it can roll itself on the ground, though it needs to fly to overcome obstructions like stairs and curbs. A version with a built-in flash-pak and smoke grenade costs 500¥ extra; detonating them destroys the drone. Use Pilot Aircraft to operate.','Core',''),(7,'Mini',NULL,NULL,'Condor','2','0R','0','1(1)',0,2,4,'6R','4,000¥','Solar-powered and hydrogen-filled, the Condor is a long-duration observation drone constructed with transparent and radar-invisible materials, allowing it to hover in place for days, even weeks, rather than the hours that a conventional drone can manage. The trade-off, of course, is that the Condor is completely vulnerable if detected and unable to flee. While the Condor’s balloon is nearly as large as kitchen table when inflated, when deflated the entire unit is smaller than a bowling pin.','SR5:R5.0',''),(8,'Mini','Aircraft',NULL,'Dragonfly','4','2P','1','1(0)',3,3,2,'12R','4,000¥','Perhaps the smallest drone-hunting drone in production today, the Dragonfly is designed to follow surveillance drones anywhere they hide and bring them down. A sleek quad-copter design with in-body rotors that are protected from collisions in tight corners, the Dragonfly comes pre-equipped with a chomping “beak” of blades, allowing it to shear through the wings or body of other mini-or-micro-drones, ripping them from the sky. Against larger drones, the Dragonfly can swarm, nipping away in small bites, but it isn’t designed to cut through any appreciable levels of armor plating.','SR5:R5.0','Melee Bite (Acc 3, Reach —, Dam 3P, AP –2), Targeting (Melee) Auotsoft'),(9,'Mini','Groundcraft',NULL,'Gerbil','4/2','2G','1','1(1)',0,2,2,'4','2,000¥','','SR5:R5.0',''),(10,'Mini','Groundcraft',NULL,'Hedgehog','3','1G','1','1(0)',0,4,3,'8F','8,000¥','A specialized sub-design of the Aztechnology Crawler, the Hedgehog is the leading security-sniffing drone on the market today. Intended to find opposition command, control, and communication broadcasts, it can listen in passively while running decrypting software. Parked in a hidden location, it can eavesdrop for up to forty-eight hours on a single charge, gathering data by the gigapulse.','SR5:R5.0','Electronic Warfare (2) Autosoft,'),(11,'Mini',NULL,NULL,'Horizon CU^3','4','1P','1','1(1)',0,2,3,'4','3,000¥','A simple single-fan vectored thrust drone, the CU is a cheaper version of the professional camera drones used by most major trideo broadcasters. The fan traded off speed for stability and whisper-quiet operation, allowing the camera to focus on the target without overwhelming the sound with the typical whirly-whoosh. Hugely popular with the P2 crowd, where it follows them everywhere and records their day, allowing them to do live updates or edit the footage later. The professional version has an improved camera, Pilot, and software, and usually operates in threes (thus the cubed designation), allowing for three camera angles in any given scene.','SR5:R5.0','Clearsight (2) Autosoft'),(12,'Mini',NULL,NULL,'Pigeon 2.0','4','2P','1','1(1)',0,2,2,'8','3,000¥','Saeder-Krupp’s small Festo subsidiary mastered the art of lifelike simulation for drones, producing the first realistic flying “bird drone” almost fifty years ago.

A niche item that is seldom fielded, the duelist has two distinct advantages: its humanoid profile allows it to be mistaken for a more-versatile metahuman guard at a distance, making it useful at facilities guarded by skeleton crews, and its blade-arms are allegedly marginally more effective at combating spirits than the traditional drone combat payloads of guns and more guns. This drone comes with a unique Rating 3 Targeting (Swords) autosoft and mounts a pair of standard swords in special weapon mounts.

Characters can only defeat voice recognition systems by “speaking” with the voice of an approved user—by using a recording, some other simulation, or the real voice. Voice modulator cyberware can also be used. An Opposed Test must be made between the voice recognition system and the equipment used to bypass it; whichever generates more hits, wins.\nBreath, cellular, and DNA scanners collect a sample of the user’s cells, either off the finger/palm, via hair suction, through exhaled particles, or something similar, and analyze the genetic material. In order to fool such a system, you need a sample of the correct genetic material, preserved in a specially formulated enzyme bath. The enzyme bath can be synthesized in a chemistry shop with a Chemistry + Logic (5, 1 hour) Extended Test.\nFacial recognition scanners use imaging lasers, thermographic, and/or ultrasonic waves to map a person’s face. These are one of the least intrusive, but also least accurate, biometric recognition systems. Facial recognition systems are useful not just for letting authorized people in, but also for identifying unwanted people and keeping them out. Prosthetic makeup and biosculpting can be used with varying degrees of effectiveness against facial recognition; make an Opposed Test pitting Disguise + Intuition [Mental] against the Device rating.

Not having a SIN means living outside the system, living with restricted or non-existent civil rights. Shadowrunners by default are SINless—they have a SIN only if they have the SINner quality (p. 84). Most runners don’t have one, either because they were unfortunate enough to be born poor, or because they lost it or ditched it somewhere along the way. SINs are digital, not physical objects. They exist on your commlink, or in your PAN. Getting by without a SIN can be a pain, so most runners settle for the next best thing: a fake. High quality fakes are difficult for The Man to spot; low quality fakes are … less good. The rating of the fake SIN is used in tests against verification systems (Fake SINs, p. 367) . Just like a real SIN, anytime you use a fake SIN for legitimate activity, you leave a datatrail in your wake. The fact that criminal activities can be tracked to fake SINs makes fake SINs inherently disposable. Most runners operate two or more fake SINs at a time, one for legal activity like paying rent and going shopping, another for shadier activity, and possibly a third to be used only when it’s time to get the hell outta Dodge.','Core',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,'','',0,0,'',0,''),(322,'Fake License','Misc','Identification',1,6,'','(Rating x 3)F','Rating x 200¥','For those who can’t or won’t go through the standard legal channels, fake licenses are available for all kinds of restricted items and activities.

Each type of item/activity permission requires a separate license. Things that require licenses include hunting (bow and rifle), possession of a firearm, concealed carry of a firearm (separate license), spellcasting, and any Restricted gear or augmentations, etc. Just as SINs essentially exist on your commlink, fake licenses exist on your SIN and are linked to it. When you buy a fake concealed-carry license, you don’t buy it for Murderman the professional shadowrunner, you buy it for John Doe, one of Murderman’s fake SINs.

This rebate is cumulative with the reduction offered by the chosen ’ware’s grade, if any (e.g., the reduction for alphaware of 0.8 is reduced by ten percent, or 0.08, to become 0.72, and is rounded down to 0.7). This quality can only be chosen for bioware or cyberware. This quality may only be taken once.','Positive','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(13,'Black Market Pipeline','10 KARMA','During character creation, the player chooses one existing individual contact and a single category of merchandise (e.g., vehicles, weapons, electronics, armor, etc.). The selected contact can always buy or sell goods in that category through the black market with better-than-normal rates for the character. Purchases through this contact get a ten percent price reduction and a +2 dice pool modifier for the Availability Test. When looking to sell goods through the contact, the character gets (7 percent x Loyalty) of the item’s original value instead of the standard 5 percent. The contact has to be appropriate to the category chosen, though creativity can be king here.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(14,'Blandness','8 KARMA','This character blends into a crowd; he’s seldom noticed and easily forgotten. He is unremarkable in every aspect of physical appearance. Anyone attempting to describe the character cannot come up with anything more precise than “average height, average build, average hair, etc.” Increase the threshold for anyone to recall specific details about the character by 1. This means a Memory Test with a difficulty of Average (threshold of 2) becomes a Hard test (threshold of 3). Individuals attempting to shadow or physically locate a character with the Blandness quality in a populated setting receive a –2 dice pool modifier on all tests related to their search. The same penalty applies if they’re asking around about the person based on the individual’s physical appearance. The modifier does not, however, apply to magical or Matrix searches. If the character acquires any visible tattoos, scars, obvious cyberware, or other distinguishing features, the bonuses from the Blandness quality go away until the distinctive features are removed from the character’s appearance.  In certain circumstances and specific situations, the gamemaster may determine that Blandness does not apply. For example, a troll with the Blandness quality still towers head and shoulders over a crowd of humans and so still stands out, no matter how average their horns may be. The character only regains his bonus by leaving the situation where he stands out.','Positive','Core','',1,'Notoriety:-1','',0,''),(15,'Born Rich','5 KARMA','Richie Rich has fallen into the shadows. The character came from an affluent background (e.g., high-level corporate kid, old-money family, Mafia princess, lottery winner), but is not necessarily still wealthy or doesn’t have access to this additional wealth. During character creation, characters can normally gain extra resources at a rate of 2,000 nuyen per Karma point, up to 10 Karma maximum (p. 94, SR5). With this quality, available only during character creation, characters may exceed the usual 10 Karma limit and instead trade up to 40 Karma total at the same exchange rate of 2,000 nuyen per Karma point, for up to 80,000 nuyen of additional funds.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(16,'Brand Loyalty','3 KARMA','Brand loyalty is taken to extremes in the Sixth World with individuals brainwashed by their megacorporate masters, especially when it comes to firearms. But sometimes being loyal to a brand can be a good thing. Characters who are brand loyal know the products of their favorite brand inside and out. The quality has two levels; Manufacturer and Product. At the Manufacturer level, characters choose a corporate or manufacturer brand, i.e. Ares, Saeder-Krupp, Krime, H&K, Novatech, etc., and gain a +1 dice pool bonus on every roll involving gear made by their manufacturer. At the Product level the bonus is only conveyed on a single item, i.e. Predator IV, S-K-Bentley Concordat, Krime Kannon, HK227, Novatech Airware, etc.  On the downside, due to this narrow focus the character suffers a –1 dice pool penalty whenever working with a piece of gear not made by their preferred Manufacturer. At the Product level the –1 dice pool penalty is applied to all products of the same type, i.e., heavy pistols, cars, SMGs, assault cannons, commlinks, etc.','Positive','SR5:R&G','',1,'','',0,''),(17,'Catlike','7 KARMA','A character with the Catlike quality is gifted with an uncanny elegance, a stealthy gait, and an almost preternatural ability to move without making a sound. They also claim they land on their feet when dropped, though they tend not to let people test this. This quality adds a +2 dice pool modifier to Sneaking skill tests.','Positive','Core','',1,'','Sneaking:2',0,''),(18,'Chaser','4 KARMA','Something about reeling in a car, boat, or plane that is trying to get away from you gives you a sense of urgency and intensity that makes you perform at your peak.

Any time you perform any Chase Action (p. 204, SR5), you receive a +2 dice pool bonus.','Positive','SR5:R5.0','',1,'','',0,''),(19,'City Slicker','7 KARMA','A character with this quality has the asphalt and concrete of the sprawl in his blood. They would choose the noise and chaos of the city over the suburbs or rural areas any day of the week. They have an instinct for navigating urban environments. This quality provides a +1 dice pool modifier for all skills in the Outdoors skill group when in an urban environment. The downside is the character suffers a –1 dice pool modifier to Perception and Survival Tests when in any non-urban environment.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(20,'Codeslinger','10 KARMA','Ones and zeroes are practically a native language to a Codeslinger. The character is adept at performing a particular Matrix action (which she selects when she selects this quality) and receives a +2 dice pool modifier to that Matrix action. This can only be selected for Matrix Actions (p. 237) that have a test associated with them.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(21,'College Education','4 KARMA','The halls of academe are well known to your character. Thanks to time spent actually studying while at college instead of partying, the character can buy Academic Knowledge skills at half price (rounded up) during character creation. After character creation, Academic Knowledge skill ranks of 3 or higher receive a 1 Karma cost reduction for each rank.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'MentalLimit:1','',0,''),(22,'Common Sense','3 KARMA','“Common sense is not so common” as they say. It’s nothing supernatural, just a keen sense of knowing when something is just a bad idea. Any time a character with this quality is about to do something the gamemaster deems foolish, the gamemaster must act as their proverbial inner voice of reason and issue a little warning. The gamemaster can only give a number of warnings per session equal to or less than the character’s Edge rating. After that, they’re on their own.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(23,'Cyber Singularity Seeker','12 KARMA','In the Sixth World, many accept cyberware as a means to an end, as a way to augment their capacity. For most it is a trade-off between their sense of self and being more capable. For you, though, cyberware is the end. You believe that the more chrome you get, the closer you get to some sort of point of nirvana, of hitting a singularity where you blend man and machine to perfection. The character gains +1 Willpower for every two full cyberlimb replacements they get (partial limb replacements don’t count), up to a maximum of +2 Willpower.','Positive','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(24,'Daredevil','6 KARMA','Better to be lucky than good, when you’re living on the edge.

Whenever the character performs an exceptionally daring action (gamemaster’s discretion), she gets two points of Edge back instead of one.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(25,'Data Anomaly','3 KARMA','An incessant code tinkerer, you know very effective ways to hide your icon, making it look like nothing more than a piece of errant code. You gain +2 dice when resisting a Matrix Perception test while running silent. Unfortunately, whatever it is you’re doing to hide yourself has one little flaw—sprites, those mysterious creatures of the Matrix, can spot you instantly, exactly as if you weren’t running silent at all.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(26,'Dealer Connection','3 KARMA','At some point in your wide travels and extra-legal activities, you met someone who has access to retail vehicles, and your connection means that you get vehicles at a discount. When selecting this quality, pick a class of vehicle (ground craft, watercraft, aircraft, or drones). Each time you purchase a vehicle of that class, you receive ten percent off the price. The discount is taken after the gamemaster makes adjustment to the price based on Availability. This quality may be taken up to four times, once for each class of vehicle.','Positive','SR5:R5.0','',1,'','',0,''),(27,'Digital Doppelganger','7 KARMA','The Matrix is a big place, and with a world so connected and so tied to identity, there are bound to be some crossed signals somewhere. The character’s digital identity, including their spending habits, licenses, travel records, and data trail have all been cross-linked with someone else’s identity. Anyone doing research on him has a hard time locating any information and faces a +2 threshold for Matrix Searches for tracking the character on this ID. The character must be a SINner, and this quality should be linked to a particular SIN.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(28,'Disgraced','2 KARMA','The character used to be a figure of authority, feared in the streets and publicly lauded as a hero until his reputation got tarnished (justly or unjustly), and he was cast out of his community. Such was the character’s fearsome reputation that criminals (gangers, organized crime members, and so on, as determined by the gamemaster) still treat him warily. The character receives a +2 dice pool modifier when attempting to intimidate such individuals. However, any upright citizen will treat the character with the disdain reserved for disgraced heroes, being treated as Prejudiced in any Etiquette Test.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(29,'Double Jointed','6 KARMA','A Double-Jointed character has unusually flexible joints and can bend and contort his body into extreme positions. The character receives a +2 dice pool modifier for Escape Artist tests. The character may also be able to squeeze into small, cramped spaces where less limber characters cannot. They’re also great at parties and bars.','Positive','Core','',1,'','Escape_Artist:2',0,''),(30,'Drug Tolerant','6 KARMA','The character has a higher-than-average tolerance for drugs (sometimes called Ozzy Osborne Syndrome). This could be due to a hardy constitution, or a natural genetic mutation that allows for better absorption and filtering of foreign chemicals from their system. The character in question receives +2 dice to all Addiction Tests (p. 414, SR5) to resist addiction. They gain no bonus, however, for attempting to dry out after being addicted.','Positive','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(31,'Elemental Focus','10 KARMA','Your magic manifests more easily with one element than the rest. Choose an elemental type when taking this quality. When casting spells of that type, you get a +2 dice pool modifer. Drain you may take from casting spells of that type is of the same type. You also suffer the secondary effects of that type.','Positive','SR5:HT','',1,'','',0,''),(32,'Erased','8 KARMA','There are characters who lack a SIN because they never had one, and then there are those who had a SIN but had it actively and thoroughly erased, to the point where legwork can only be done via word-of-mouth contacts, and Matrix searches turn up nothing. Also, the quality prevents Public Awareness for the character from ever going above 1.  This is a double-edged sword. The character can never maintain a Lifestyle higher than Middle, and can never used a fake SIN or any attached licenses for more than three months. Living under the radar is expensive. If a character chooses to have a High Lifestyle for a month, she’ll need to bail on it and lay low for a bit with a Low or lower Lifestyle for at least a month. If they fail to do so, the systems in place start to slip, making the character locatable via the Matrix and possibly building a Public Awareness—which means that whatever they were hiding from might have a chance to find them.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(33,'Exceptional Attribute','14 KARMA','The Exceptional Attribute quality is how you get to be the charismatic troll, or the agile dwarf. It allows you to possess one attribute at a level one point above the metatype maximum limit. For example, an ork character with the Exceptional Attribute quality for Strength could take his Strength attribute up to 10 before augmentations are applied, instead of the normal limit of 9. Exceptional Attribute also applies toward Special Attributes such as Magic and Resonance. Edge cannot affected by the Exceptional Attribute (Edge is raised by another quality called Lucky). A character may only take Exceptional Attribute once, and only with the gamemaster’s approval.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(34,'Fade To Black','7 KARMA','When the opposition starts getting marks on you, you know the hurt isn’t far behind. That feeling of the noose tightening around your neck, the race to get them before they get you … well, you hate that drek. So much so that you have developed your vanishing act technique. When making a Complex Action to perform the Erase Mark action, if you succeed in erasing all marks on you, you may then immediately perform a Hide action as part of the same Complex Action you just took.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(35,'Fame (Local Fame)','4 KARMA','Now if you can just get fortune and money you’ll have the trifecta. The problem is you’ve got the element that is not particularly cherished in the shadows. Whether you’re a former trid star, a local politician, a retired or injured sports star, or the latest up-and-coming rocker, your face is well known. It may be just the local community, a single nation or corp, or possibly the world that knows your ugly mug. No matter who they are or how many folks know your profile, being so recognizable has its pros and cons.  First, on the pro side, Fame offers benefits within certain social circles and additional income if the character also chooses the Day Job quality.  That may sound nice, but being well known is not a great way to get work in the shadows, and therefore causes problems on the darker side of life. Characters with this quality are more likely to be recognized by passers-by or others who see them during a run, which can be a problem. And remember that Fame often involves strings; one of the biggest is having a SIN. Characters who choose this quality must have the SINner quality or a Rating 3 fake SIN.    City politics, hometown sports teams, and local news stations are some of the most common sources of local fame. Select a single sprawl at character creation to be the base of the character’s fame. In the public eye of that sprawl, the character gains a 1-point increase to their Social Limit and a +1 dice pool modifier on all Social Skill tests to positively influence someone who knows of their fame.  The downside is that anyone from the chosen sprawl can identify famous characters with an Intuition + Logic (2) Test, so characters need to be careful about who sees them when they are on the job.

For example, a magic user with Focused Concentration rating 3 may sustain a Force 3 Armor spell without taking the negative dice pool modifier for sustaining a spell.

When she needs to find a safe location in a hurry, this character receives a +2 dice pool bonus to her Intuition + appropriate street knowledge skill to find a suitable place to hole up fast.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(54,'Home Ground (Street Politics)','10 KARMA','If a character knows her neighborhood better than anyone—the shortcuts, the hiding places, and the people she can trust—then she probably has the Home Ground quality. She knows the families who live there, their stories, and what the kids who moved out are doing; she knows the streets better than GridGuide, knows things that aren’t on GridGuide, and knows when GridGuide is wrong. She knows the politics of the gangs, who’s running for whom and who’s running from whom. But it’s not just the physical streets. Depending on the character, her Home Ground quality can manifest in ways specific to who and what she is. When choosing this quality, select one of the bonuses below: This character knows the street gangs, the criminal operations, and the beneath-the-surface affiliations that are the social and political fabric of her Home Ground. She receives a +2 dice pool modifier for Knowledge Tests relating to gangs or their operations.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(55,'Human-looking','6 KARMA','A metahuman character with the Human-Looking quality can pass for human in most circumstances. Human NPCs respond with neutral attitudes toward such characters when making Social skill tests (p. 82), even those humans who are particularly biased against metahumans. The character may suffer increased animosity from metahuman NPCs who are prejudiced against humans and who either mistake him for human or distrust his motives for trying to look human.','Positive','Core','Non-Human Metatype',1,'','',0,''),(56,'I C U','6 KARMA','In the shadows, everyone always runs silent, right? To you, what gives them away is the obviousness of the lack of activity. You’re so used to this, you know exactly what to look for. So long as you have visual sight on a target that is running silent, or carrying silent-running devices, you get +2 to your Matrix Perception to spot their hidden icon(s).','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(57,'Indomitable (Physical)','8 KARMA PER RATING','Bodies and minds have limits, but some people have the will to push right through those boundaries. For each level of Indomitable, a character receives a +1 increase to an Inherent limit of his choice (Mental, Physical, or Social). He can take up to three levels and can apply them in any way he chooses (+3 to one Inherent Limit, for example; or +2 to one Inherent and +1 to another; or +1 to all three).','Positive','Core','',3,'PhysicalLimi:1','',0,''),(58,'Inspired','4 KARMA','Slapping paint on a canvas or words on a page is easy and requires only a medium and a mouth to tout one’s own amazing talents and insights. But to make something worthwhile, something that deserves to be called art, pieces that speak for themselves and stand the test of time, requires true talent. An Inspired character is touched by a muse (figuratively we hope, though gamemasters can see Street Grimoire for the literal) and is considered an artistic genius by his peers for his remarkable raw talent. The quality grants the character an additional Street Cred of 2 (p. 372, SR5) among fellow artists familiar with his reputation. Inspired characters also gain a +1 dice pool modifier for all Artisan skills or Performance skills they possess; the player must choose which category the quality applies to when it is chosen, and the quality can only be selected once.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(59,'Jack Of All Trades Master Of None','2 KARMA','The character has an incredible aptitude for learning new skills. Unfortunately, the character quickly gets bored and gets turned off when things start getting a little hard. Karma costs are reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for learning skills up to Rating 5. Beyond Rating 5, however, it costs 2 additional points of Karma for each point of skill. This quality does not apply during character creation.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(60,'Juryrigger','10 KARMA','Juryrigger gives a character an intuitive grasp of the inner workings and underlying principles of mechanical and electronic devices. She knows how to repair the broken, rejuvenate the worn, improve a device’s efficiency, or coax it into doing things it’s designers hadn’t intended. Characters with the Juryrigger quality receive a +2 dice pool modifier for Mechanical Tests when juryrigging gear. If the gamemaster decides what the character wants to accomplish is in fact possible, he determines the threshold for her success using the Build/Repair Table (p. 146) as a guideline, then reduces the threshold for the test by 1. While a successful Mechanics Skill Test enables the Juryrigger to perform amazing technical feats, everything she devises is temporary. Examples of what a character may be able to do with Juryrigger include: Juryrig a destroyed device so that it will operate just one more time (for 1D6 minutes).  Tweak an electronic device to function at a rating one higher than normal for 1D6 Combat Turns.  Temporarily coax extra performance from a vehicle’s or drone’s components, increasing its Sensor or Handling by +1 (if combined with bonuses from Gearhead, the vehicle’s or drone’s critical components completely burn out at the end of the duration from being pushed well beyond their limits; at that point, the vehicle or drone becomes a big paperweight).  Improvise a one-shot device or weapon from disparate components (the gamemaster has final say on whether suitable parts are available).  Devise an impromptu means to bypass a security measure, such as a trip beam or pressure plate.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(61,'Lightning Reflexes','20 KARMA','Some people are just born fast. This quality provides an unaugmented character the ability to react with astonishing speed. The character gains +1 to their Initiative rating and a bonus initiative die. This quality is not cumulative with any other Initiative enhancement, be it technological, chemical, or magical. They also receive a +1 dice pool modifier for all Defense Tests.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(62,'Linguist','4 KARMA','Nothing impresses an out-of-town Johnson more than negotiating in their native tongue. And knowing when they’re telling their goon squad to kill you is pretty useful too. This quality represents a natural gift for learning and understanding languages. Characters with this quality halve the learning time for a language, and the quality also provides a +1 dice pool modifier to all Language skill tests the character makes. If this quality is purchased at character creation, the player purchases Language skill points at a 2-for-1 rate. After character creation, language skill ranks of 3 or higher receive a 1 Karma cost reduction for each rank.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(63,'Lucky','12 KARMA','The dice roll and the coin flips this character’s way more often than not, giving her the chance to drop jaws in amazement at her good fortune. Lucky allows a character to possess an Edge attribute one point higher than his metatype maximum (for example, a human character could raise her Edge to 8). Note that taking this quality does not actually increase the character’s current Edge rating, it just allows her the opportunity to do so; the Karma cost for gaining the extra point must still be paid. This quality may only be taken once and must be approved by the gamemaster. The Lucky quality cannot be combined with Exceptional Attribute.','Positive','Core','',1,'Notoriety:-1','',0,''),(64,'Made Man','5 KARMA','As a minor member of an organized crime syndicate, the character can occasionally call on its resources. At the time of purchase, select a crime syndicate as a free Group Contact (see Group or Organization Contact Options, p. 176). As the character is an actual member of the syndicate, Loyalty is increased to 3 instead of starting at 1. This status also allows him to use the syndicate as a reliable fence for stolen goods (they get thirty percent of the items’ value) or as a source for stolen and restricted goods (ten percent price reduction and a +1 dice pool modifier for the Availability Test). Everything comes with a price, though. The character is expected to participate in syndicate work, taking at least twenty hours of his time every week in a standard campaign, and costing the character one out of every four weeks in Missions play.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(65,'Magic Resistance','6 KARMA PER RATING','This is the wonderful ability to potentially make a Fireball bounce away. For every 6 Karma spent on Magic Resistance, a character receives 1 additional die for Spell Resistance Tests. The Magical Resistance quality, however, is always “on”—the character cannot lower it to receive beneficial spells such as Heal. A character with Magic Resistance cannot take part in spells that require a voluntary subject; such spells automatically fail when used on magic-resistant characters.','Positive','Core','Non-Magic Characters Only',4,'SpellResist:[Rating]','',0,''),(66,'Mentor Spirit','5 KARMA','Everyone needs some help in life, even if it comes from someone relatively filmy and insubstantial. Mentor Spirit means the character follows a patron spirit (see Mentor Spirits, p. 320) that guides him in his practice of magic and provides certain advantages and disadvantages to his natural abilities. A character may change mentor spirits, but he may have only one mentor spirit at a time. To change mentor spirits, the character must first buy off the current mentor spirit as if it were a Negative quality. He can then purchase the quality again to follow a different mentor spirit. This cost represents the toll of divorcing from one mentor spirit and bonding with a new one.  Each tradition has a different name for a mentor spirit. Hermetic mages prefer the term “mentor spirit,” while shamans use the word “totem” for the spirit that they follow. While the names may vary, the way the mentor works is consistent.This quality is only available to characters that possess a Magic attribute rating.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(67,'Natural Athlete','7 KARMA','A character with this quality has an innate combination of physical fitness, spatial awareness, and natural athletic or gymnastic talent. While the character may not be a world-class athlete and may require training to achieve peak performance, he is in prime physical shape for his size and weight class. The Natural Athlete adds a +2 dice pool modifier for Running and Gymnastics skill tests.','Positive','Core','',1,'','Running:2,Gymnastics:2',0,''),(68,'Natural Hardening','10 KARMA','This quality makes the character’s neural structure resistant to feedback. This gives her 1 point of natural biofeedback filtering, which is cumulative with a Biofeedback Filter program or a technomancer’s firewall (p. 251).','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(69,'Natural Immunity (Natural)','4 KARMA','The ability to casually sip poison can never be overrated. A character with Natural Immunity has an innate or developed immunity to one single disease or toxin. This quality is available at two levels. If purchased at the 4 Karma level, the character is immune to a single natural disease or toxin. If Natural Immunity is purchased at the full 10 Karma level, the character is immune to a single, synthetic (artificially created) disease or toxin. Natural Immunity does not affect diseases or toxins that are magically based, such as HMHVV.  The player and gamemaster must agree on the disease, drug, or poison to which the character is immune. The character can take one dose of the drug or poison and experience one exposure to the disease every six hours with no ill effects. Any subsequent dosing or exposure during the next six hours causes normal damage, but the character’s recovery time is halved. Note that characters with Natural Immunity to a disease can be a carrier, infecting other characters while suffering no ill effects.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(70,'Night Vision','2 KARMA','The name says it all. This quality provides characters with the advantages of low-light vision (see Environmental Compensation Table, p. 175, SR5). There is a downside. Thanks to the extremely light-sensitive nature of the eye, the character suffers severely from the glare of the sun (Blinding Glare on a clear day, Moderate Glare on an overcast day, etc.) but can mitigate this with sunglasses per the Environmental Compensation Table. The quality is not compatible with cyber- or bioware augmentation or replacement (meaning if you get any such replacement, this quality goes away, and the character receives no Karma in return).','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(71,'Ninja Vanish','5 KARMA','Even the best sometimes get clipped. Maybe you’re in a host, holding off some IC, but there are just too damn many of them. Maybe you’re in the middle of a firefight and the enemy hacker is getting the best of you, and you’re moments away from having your deck reformatted, when suddenly, the Matrix glitches. A little localized reset saves your bacon. Just like that. What are the odds, neh? Maybe GOD is on your side? That can’t be you must just be that good. As a Free Action, the character can spend 1 point of Edge to remove all marks a single opponent has on him. Note that in cases where other targets were sharing marks with your target, such as IC in a host, the others also lose their marks.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(72,'One Trick Pony','7 KARMA','You’ve watched the same action trid or chipped your way through the same simsense so many times you actually know how to do that really cool move the star always uses. This quality allows the character to choose one Martial Arts technique they can do without first learning the associated Martial Arts style.','Positive','SR5:R&G','',1,'','',0,''),(73,'Online Fame','4 KARMA','Congratulations, you’re famous! Well, sort of. You are only famous as a Matrix persona. Maybe you’re a famous blogger, an online gaming hero, or a cyberpunk roleplaying-game freelance author (be still your beating heart). People know your icon and your signature, but even your most ardent fan wouldn’t recognize you if they passed you in the street on a brightly lit day. Further, none would actually believe you if you tried to tell them (quite the opposite, in fact). You gain +2 dice to your Social tests and +2 dice to your Social Limit when interacting with someone who knows you, but only when you interact with them via the Matrix. Characters who see your icon are able to identify you with a successful Intuition + Logic (2) Test.    Any character who is able to see both your icon and your physical self is thrown into a conflict. Either they will believe you are truly him, or they will refuse to believe and think you are trying to impersonate, erm, yourself. If they believe you, your bonus becomes +3 on Social Tests and Social Limit toward your ecstatic fan, which now applies to all interactions, not just Matrix ones. However, if they do not believe you, you suffer –4 to all Social interactions. In addition, the character may outright attack you or call the police to report you. To determine a character’s reaction, the gamemaster may roll a single D6. On a roll of 5 or 6, the character believes you. On any other roll, the character does not.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(74,'Otaku To Techomancer','10 KARMA','You were an otaku, a child of the Matrix, bending the Matrix to the will of your mind alone, before it was cool to do so. Most of your kind, assuming they even survived this long, did not emerge as technomancers. But for you, lightning struck twice—you went from otaku to technomancer. Having known your abilities for longer than just about anyone else alive, dealing with these strange powers is second nature to you. You gain +2 dice when resisting Fading from any source.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(75,'Outdoorsman','3 KARMA','A character with this quality is often described as woodsy. They are far more comfortable in wilderness and rural environments than in the urban blight of the modern city. They are naturals at tracking and hunting, with a sense of direction even a compass could rely on. This quality provides a +2 dice pool modifier for all skills in the Outdoors skill group when in a rural or wild environment. The downside is the character suffers a –1 dice pool modifier to Perception and Survival Tests when in an urban environment.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(76,'Overclocker','5 KARMA','The character is able to coax more juice out of his gear. The character may add 1 point of Rating to one of his cyberdeck’s ASDF attributes. This point can be reallocated as desired any time the cyberdeck is reconfigured.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(77,'Pain Is Gain','5 KARMA','Virtual reality—especially hot sim—can be addictive. But what people don’t understand is how exhilarating slicing through the Matrix really is. Not just the simsense feedback. No. To you, it’s the thrill of the fight. You never feel more alive than that moment when searing white-hot pain hits you between the eyes as the IC tries to fry you. It’s the knowledge that your life is on the line as you redline it, all at the speed of thought, that gets you juiced up.    The character gains +2 to their current Initiative Score on any turn she suffers Biofeedback damage (Stun or Physical). This extra score comes into effect at the same time damage is incurred and lasts only for the current Combat Turn. The character may only gain 2 points of Initiative per Combat Turn in this way, no matter how many times they get slapped around.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(78,'Perceptive','5 KARMA PER RATING','The devil is in the details, and you see those horns regularly. This quality is available at two levels. For 5 Karma, characters receive a +1 dice pool modifier on all Perception Tests, including Astral and Matrix Perception. For 10 Karma, the modifier increases to +2.','Positive','SR5:RF','',2,'','Perception:1,Assensing:1',0,''),(79,'Perceptive Defender','4 KARMA','Sometimes keeping yourself alive is about staying alert and keeping an eye out for incoming trouble, about knowing what’s coming before it’s time to duck or dive for cover. This quality allows the character to use their Perception skill in place of their Willpower attribute while using Full Defense. Including this skill in the Defense Test means that their Mental limit also applies.','Positive','SR5:R&G','',1,'','',0,''),(80,'Perfect Time','5 KARMA','Who needs a watch when you’re around? The character with this quality always knows the time, down to the minute, and has a perfect sense of rhythm and timing. This perfect sense can only be obstructed through prolonged isolation, unconsciousness, or distortion of temporal perception through drugs, chips, or an extended period in the Matrix. This quality provides two game benefits: a +1 dice pool modifier for Performance Tests involving timing and rhythm, along with an additional Free Action during every Action Phase.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(81,'Photographic Memory','6 KARMA','A character with Photographic Memory can instantly recall facts, dates, numbers, or anything else he has seen or heard.

All ritual sorcery, including friendly efforts, directed at the character receives a –2 dice pool modifier for the Ritual Spellcasting Test during Step 7: Seal the Ritual.

Increase your limit by 1 in a single non-combat skill.','Positive','SR5:HT','',1,'','',0,''),(85,'Prime Datahaven Membership','7 KARMA','JackPoint, the Nexus, the Helix—legendary sites of information sharing among the shadowrunner elite. Access to these sites is invitation-only, and guess what you’ve been invited! You’ll be a probationary member for a while, but that’s still not bad. You pretty much gain access to most of the information you might ever want, you’re just not necessarily privy to the administrative secrets of the haven and some of the more sensitive posts. These sites all operate on a give-to-be-given, information-should-be-free mentality. You will be expected to feed the dataHaven with regular posts sharing your expertise and detailing some of the things you encounter, though it is accepted as a mark of professionalism to censor your information so as to not include names or details that might lead to identification of the specific players involved.    When choosing this quality, pick one of these famous datahavens. It will act as a Group Contact (p. 176, Run Faster). The Group Contact is considered to have a Loyalty of 3 and Connection of 5.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(86,'Privileged Family Name','7 KARMA','With this quality the character’s family is exceptionally well-connected, and his real name carries significant clout in his home sprawl (selected at character creation). Though probably known as a rich, spoiled brat, the name (and accompanying SIN and ID) is like a get-out-of-jailfree card for small misdemeanors (such as being caught carrying a weapon, casting an unauthorized mental manipulation spell, or driving a car without a license). Even when trying to act tough, local minor NPCs suffer a –2 dice pool modifier on Social tests against the character. In order to have this quality the character must also possess the SINner (National or Corporate) quality. Remember that this quality also makes the character very easy to identify if those not concerned with their family name start asking questions.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(87,'Profiler','3 KARMA','If you know someone well, you can often guess their actions. Simple enough in theory, and something that you have mastered. Given enough information about someone, you are able to get into their head and know what buttons to push and how to manipulate them. With an appropriate dossier on a person and one hour to study it, you gain a modifier to your dice pool and your Social Limit on all Social Tests involving that person, equal to the net hits on a Matrix Search test (maximum +3).    An appropriate dossier can be gathered via a Matrix Search test. The threshold is always at least 3, but depending on the individual may be as high as 6 (gamemaster’s discretion). The information required is always Obscure (–2 modifier) and may be On Another Grid (further –2 modifier, gamemaster’s discretion).    The downside to the character’s ability to profile others so well is an inability to react smoothly when unprepared. The character suffers –1 to their Social Limit in any and all situations where they could not prepare.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(88,'Prototype Transhuman','10 KARMA','There are always rumors in the shadows of this or that megacorp or organization working to build an army of super soldiers. Those rumors always seem to persist, always seem to be around. Some choose to believe, others don’t, but for them, it’s a matter of opinion. For you, it’s a matter of fact. You are an extremely rare, genetically crafted, experimental post-human prototype.    Unfortunately, this has its ups and downs. You were built better than a normal human, so you may pick up to 1 point of Essence of bioware (not cyberware). While you must pay the normal cost in nuyen of the bioware and otherwise follow all character creation rules, you do not incur any essence cost. So, essentially, you gain up to 1 point of free Essence to be used exclusively on bioware. These special organs were genetically grown into you from your inception—they are as much a natural part of you as your liver or heart.    However, the downside of being a rare, one-of-akind transhuman prototype is that, well, something is wrong with you. As part of this Quality, you must also pick one of the following negative qualities: Wanted, Allergy (Common, Mild), Astral Beacon, or Insomnia (10). You do not get the Karma bonus for this Negative Quality. This additional Negative Quality represents that you are either wanted back by your manufacturer, or that there is something wrong with you (them’s the breaks for being a prototype).    This quality can only be taken during character creation.','Positive','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(89,'Quick Config','5 KARMA','Maybe you’re just nova-hot at moving your fingers around, or maybe your mind is highly organized. Whatever the case, reconfiguring your deck is something you do with freakish rapidity. Whenever you reconfigure your deck (p. 228, SR5), you can make two changes with a single Free Action. So, you may switch two programs for two others, or you can swap two pairs of cyberdeck attributes. You can also swap one program and one attribute pair. Note that a single attribute can only be swapped once, so there is still a limit to how much the new config can achieve.','Positive','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(90,'Quick Healer','3 KARMA','A character with the Quick Healer quality receives a +2 dice pool modifier to all Healing Tests made on/for/by her, including magical healing.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(91,'Rad-tolerant','3 KARMA','Sometimes characters are just different. Being able to stand on the outskirts of the Cermak Blast and just stare into the nothing for days on end, or even living there with no ill effects can be a blessing in disguise. Characters with this quality double the time before they gain the Blighted quality. Characters also always face one less step for Fatigue from Environments in Radiation environments, just like the Radiation Sponge. This Quality is incompatible with the Radiation Sponge Quality.','Positive','SR5:R&G','',1,'','',0,''),(92,'Radiation Sponge','5 KARMA','Something about the cells of characters with this quality makes them more resistant to radiation’s harmful effects, but it also makes them hold onto that radiation for longer. The character always faces one less step for Fatigue from Environments in Radiation environments, and therefore never faces a Deadly environment. If a character spends time in a Deadly environment, treat it as an Extreme environment for Fatigue purposes; use the Deadly environment times and double the length of time for carrying Radiation with them.  For example, Glowboy is a Radiation Sponge who makes a two-minute jaunt into the heart of Glow City in Redmond to prove a point. He comes out a little tired but excited to tell his pals all about the trip. When his pals start falling over, Glowboy tries to help them but they only seem to get worse. Glowboy is carrying a Deadly environment around with him for 4 minutes after he leaves, plenty of time to kill his less-radiation-friendly pals. He will also be carrying around a Harsh environment for 48 hours and a Mild environment for 48 more. Best he keeps away from other people for awhile.','Positive','SR5:R&G','',1,'','',0,''),(93,'Redliner','10 KARMA','Any cyberlimbs you have installed are jacked-to-themax, with safety limits disabled and performance overclocked beyond what the warranty normally covers, and that’s the way you like it. You receive +1 Strength and +1 Agility for every two full cyberarms or cyberlegs installed, up to a maximum of +2 for both attributes (sorry, no super centipede-man builds). The downside to pushing your ’ware that hard, however, is that the strain is quite damaging. You lose three Physical Condition Monitor boxes per two full cyberarms and legs installed. Normally, every cyberlimb gives you one additional box, but with this quality, after two full limbs you end up with net one less box (i.e., –1 instead of +2).','Positive','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(94,'Resistance to Pathogens and Toxins','8 KARMA','A character with Resistance to Pathogens/Toxins can fight off diseases and drugs more easily than other characters and receives a +1 dice pool modifier to Resistance Tests. This quality comes at two levels: at 4 Karma the character is resistant to either pathogens or toxins, not both. If the character purchases this quality at 8 Karma, she receives the +1 modifier for resisting both.','Positive','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(95,'Restricted Gear','10 KARMA PER ITEM','Right place, right time, right friend, or the stars aligned. No matter the reason, the character has managed to acquire or get a line on one piece of really hard-tofind gear she absolutely had to have. The character can take this quality up to three times; only one of those times can occur at character creation. Selecting it at character creation allows the character to buy a piece of gear with an Availability of up to 24 (circumventing the normal Availability limit at character creation). After character creation, taking this quality lets the character purchase one piece of gear with an Availability up to 18 during play with just a single commcall. They do, however, have to pay an extra thirty percent for the item.','Positive','SR5:RF','',3,'','',0,''),(96,'Revels In Murder','8 KARMA','Calling you psychotic might be going too far, but in any case it’s doubtful anyone is going to debate the point to your face. Killing brings you joy. Maybe it’s the thrill of the ultimate test of your skills, the ultimate redline, kill or be killed, and the triumph of victory that keep you going. Maybe you just like gore. The Sixth World is a cold place, chummer, and you get your kicks where you can.    When a character with this quality uses a point of Edge as part of an offensive combat action against a target and causes enough damage to send that target into physical overflow, the character immediately regains the spent point of Edge.    To qualify, the target must be aware of the possibility of damage and not willing to receive it, and they must be a metahuman (human, ork, troll, elf, dwarf, or any associated metavariant). Critters, spirits, and the like do not count. In case of doubt as to whether a target counts or not, the gamemaster has final say.','Positive','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(97,'School Of Hard Knocks','4 KARMA','The streets were this character’s classroom. Thanks to all the time spent trying to stay one step ahead of the next guy, and knowing that knowledge is power on the streets, the character can buy Street Knowledge skills at a rate of 2 for 1 during character creation. After character creation, Street Knowledge skill ranks of 3 or higher receive a 1 Karma cost reduction for each rank.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(98,'Sense Of Direction','3 KARMA','Sometimes the compass asks you which way is north. This quality allows even the most citified character to always know true north. With even a single rank in the Survival skill, she can always retrace her path.

The quality offers a +1 dice pool modifier on Navigation skill tests.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','Navigation:1',0,''),(99,'Sensei','5 KARMA','You don’t know what you don’t know. This quality gives you someone who knows what you don’t know and has chosen you to be the recipient of their knowledge. The character selects a skill or skill group for their Sensei to have mastered when the quality is purchased. They must have a contact of Connection Rating 3 or higher with expertise in the area they will teach the character. If they choose a single skill, the Sensei has the skill at a Rating of 13, as well as an Instruction Test dice pool of 10 and a limit of 7. If a skill group is chosen, the Sensei has it at 12 and has an Instruction Test dice pool of 12 with a limit of 8. The Sensei charges nothing for her services to the character, and she generally should be available to the character, though the specifics of the relationship are under the gamemaster’s discretion.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(100,'Sharpshooter','4 KARMA','Through focus and vigilance it’s possible to hone a shooting skill to the point of an excess of precision. This honing means that specific techniques are trained to the point of perfection, but in that training, other, more basic maneuvers are skipped over. Characters with this quality are more skilled at making Called Shots, but at the cost of their basic shooting skills. Penalties for Called Shots are decreased by 2, while all other Ranged Attack actions suffer a –1 dice pool penalty.','Positive','SR5:R&G','',1,'','',0,''),(101,'Solid Rep','2 KARMA','The character has a solid (2 Karma) or legendary (4 Karma) reputation within a certain group. He did something amazing for the group once; old members talk about it with fond memories and new recruits want to find out all about it. The character gets a Reputation bump with a certain specific group; +1 for a solid rep, +2 for a legendary rep. Even if the character goes on to do negative things to that group, his reputation is such that people want to believe it’s a just a misunderstanding. The selected group should generally have around one to five thousand members. The quality can only be taken once.','Positive','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(102,'Spacer','3 KARMA','Some people are just naturally comfortable in alternative-gravity environments.

Only characters with a Magic rating may take this quality.','Negative','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(141,'Bad Luck','12 KARMA','This character is cursed—his own luck often turns against him. When the character uses Edge, roll 1D6. On a result of 1, the point of Edge is spent, but it has the exact opposite effect intended. For example, if a character hopes to gain additional dice he loses that many dice from his dice pool. If a character spends Edge to go first in an Initiative Pass, he ends up going last. If a character spent Edge to negate a glitch, Bad Luck turns it into a critical glitch. The character suffers Bad Luck on only one Edge roll per game session. After the character has suffered his Bad Luck, he does not need to roll the test for Bad Luck for any more expenditures of Edge for the duration of that game session.','Negative','Core','',1,'Notoriety:1','',0,''),(142,'Bad Rep','7 KARMA','A character with a Bad Rep quality has a dark and lasting stain on her reputation. She may be a former Knight Errant cop known to have been particularly brutal in dealing with shadowrunners. Or word on the street might be that she once killed a member of her own runner team. If she’s Awakened and comes from a polluted region, it may be generally accepted that she’s a toxic shaman. Whether she is actually guilty of any wrongdoing is not relevant. What people believe she has done has permanently tainted the way they see her and how they deal with her. Whatever the reason, the character starts play with 3 points of Notoriety (p. 372) that can only be removed or decreased by confronting and resolving the source of the bad reputation. Only then may the Bad Rep quality be bought off with Karma.','Negative','Core','',1,'Notoriety:3','',0,''),(143,'Bi-polar','7 KARMA','A character with this quality fluctuates between periods of depression, stability, and mania. During manic periods, the character gains a +1 dice pool modifier to any tests involving Agility or Reaction. At the same time, the inability to focus for extended periods of time results in a –2 dice pool modifier for tests involving Logic or Intuition. During depressive periods, the character is lethargic, unmotivated, and unable to focus. Apply a –2 dice pool modifier to any tests involving Agility, Reaction, Logic, and Intuition. During stable times, the character feels balanced and suffers no difficulties except for those they impose on themselves.    The gamemaster rolls a die to determine the character’s current mental state. This roll should occur at the beginning of the game session, whenever the character gets a shift in activity (sleep, after a run, during a long stakeout, etc.), or whenever the gamemaster feels like it, but at least once per day. On a result of 1 or 2, the character is in a depressed state, on a 3 or 4 the character is in a manic state, and on a 5 or 6 the character is stable.    Medication to stabilize Bi-polar characters is available at a cost of 500 nuyen a month, but requires a prescription and a SIN (a fake SIN is, of course, a viable option). Failing to take meds for more than twelve hours results in a die roll by the gamemaster. On the street, the meds go for 100 nuyen a dose.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(144,'Big Regret','5 KARMA','Mistakes happen. Sometime in the character’s past they did something serious that they regret; maybe they spent time as a bunraku puppet, maybe they were part of a major political affair, or they were involved in the wrong corporate project, but it has to be something truly unpleasant (gamemaster’s discretion). The character decreases their Social Limit by 3 against anyone who knows about their past. This could result in a case of blackmail if the wrong person knows the truth. The character cannot buy off this quality unless it becomes public, at which point she gains 1 point of Notoriety and must buy off the quality as soon as possible.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(145,'Blank Slate','15 KARMA','The character in question has abused personasofts to the degree they no longer have an original personality. They enter a near-fugue state, having nearly no willpower of their own. They are easily led unless they have a personasoft running to give them a personality. This can come with or without Amnesia (p. 152, Run Faster) of varying degrees. For all intents and purposes, the original person has “died” and only the virtual personalities remain. Buying off this quality can mean either that the original personality, buried under the shock of the persona fixes for a long time, finally emerges, or that a persona installed through a personafix becomes the new permanent personality.','Negative','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(146,'Blighted (6 Months)','5 KARMA','This quality has multiple levels to represent the different long-term effects of radiation and pollution damage to the character’s system and how drastically it affects everyday life for the runner. The quality can be taken at character generation to represent a life growing up in really bad parts of the sprawl, or it can be gained by dossing down in those spots for an extended period.    The exact effects are not specified, only the effects it will have on rolls for the character. The penalties can be caused by organ shutdown, muscle spasms, cancerous growths, etc. This quality cannot be taken in campaigns that do not face the nvironments it is designed for without gamemaster approval.    Make an Edge (3) Test at the beginning of each game session. Success means no complications for that game session. Failure means they feel the pain of their rough upbringing in a harsh environment full of excess chemical or radioactivity exposure.

This means they automatically fail all vision-based Perception Tests. They also face a –4 dice pool modifier for general Perception tests, a –3 dice pool modifier for Surprise Tests, Blind Fire when in Ranged Combat, Total Darkness in Melee Combat, and any other relevant modifiers at the gamemaster’s discretion. The character cannot use cybereyes, as the blindness is a nerve issue, leaving them incapable of processing any visual stimuli, regardless of the source.    Since astral sight is not a truly visual sense, Awakened characters who are blind can still use astral perception all the time and at least have some sense of objects in the world, but gamemasters should apply the customary –2 dice pool modifier to all actions performed on the physical plane while perceiving the astral, including indirect combat spells, and keep in mind the differences between the astral and physical worlds.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(148,'Borrowed Time','20 KARMA','Runners face death on a regular basis, but usually they learn the best ways to avoid it. This quality makes avoiding it impossible; the inevitable is at your door, you’re just waiting for it to knock. It may be a fatal disease, a slow-acting poison, a precarious blockage, or a ticking cortex bomb, but no matter the source, death could arrive at any moment. There is no set time limit on the character’s expiration, only a deadly combination of three dice. At the beginning of each game session the gamemaster rolls three dice in secret; three of a kind means times up. At some point during that game session, at the perfect dramatic moment, the character dies.    This quality cannot be bought off. If the player changes their mind and wants their character to survive, the gamemaster can allow the character to survive, at a cost. When their number’s up (and not before), the character must burn all their current Edge to stay alive. The quality then goes away.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(149,'Code Of Honor','15 KARMA','The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it’s a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being “off limits.” If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can’t pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality—you can’t acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.    Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character ’s protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.    There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character’s Public Awareness by 1. The character’s job options are also limited—he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.    There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.    If a person in the character’s chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their “protected group” that is killed.    The Code of Honor can take other forms as well. For example:    Assassin’s Creed  A character never kills anyone that they are not paid to kill. Being precise as an assassin, not leaving collateral damage, and being invisible are important hallmarks of those who believe in the Assassin’s Creed. Characters who take this version of Code of Honor lose 1 point of Karma for every unintentional and/or unpaid murder they commit, and their Public Awareness goes up by 1 for each such death.  Warrior’s Code  The character who follows a Warrior’s Code maintains a strict sense of personal honor. In 2075, this likely means a character will not kill an unarmed person, take lethal action against an opponent who is unaware or unprepared for an attack (i.e., a guard who doesn’t know the runner is there), or knowingly take an action that could kill someone who is defenseless (i.e., from a stray bullet or allow someone to be killed from a sniper shot). The character loses 1 Karma per unarmed or defenseless person that they kill or allow to be killed through their actions.','Negative','Core','',1,'','',1,''),(150,'Code of Honor: Avenging Angel','8 KARMA','You only accept contracts to kill those who you believe deserve death. You will not intentionally kill any person who you believe does not deserve it.

There’s no finesse to it. Anyone can throw junk code around. A true hacker though—a true master of the skill, a true devotee of the lifestyle—will show perfection in his actions. A character with this quality will not use any action that would cause Matrix Damage, such as Spike or Brute Force (the character is allowed, however, to set Data Bomb traps). Instead, the character must find other means of defeating his enemy, such as using Hack on the Fly to gain marks to Edit or Reformat Matrix items, or perhaps just Jamming Signals. The character will lose 1 point of Karma per target that he willingly causes direct Matrix Damage to (aside from Data Bombs).','Negative','SR5:DT','Minimum Hacking Skill Of 3 Or Technomancer',1,'','',0,''),(152,'Codeblock','10 KARMA','A character with the Codeblock quality always has trouble with a particular Matrix action. He receives a –2 dice pool modifier any time he attempts that type of Matrix action.

Characters cannot apply Codeblock toward hacking actions they are never likely to take.','Negative','Core','',1,'','',1,''),(153,'Combat Junkie','7 KARMA','The character just can’t keep from starting fights. His first solution is always fight, and so is his second, third, and fourth. If someone suggests more options than that to the character, they’ve probably been punched already. The point is, no matter what the actual plan is, this character will always look for a chance to get a little combat on.    This quality manifests in two different ways. If the character is in a stressful situation, they must make a Composure (4) Test in order to restrain themselves from just punching their way out of the situation. If they are following a plan and an unexpected event occurs, their first reaction will be to opt for violence unless they succeed in an Intuition + Logic (4) Test and remember to stop and think about whether there might be a better option.

On the character’s first Initiative Test, the character divides their Initiative Score for that round in half (rounded up). In subsequent Combat Turns, the character may roll their normal Initiative. Combat Paralysis also gives the character a –3 dice pool modifier on Surprise Tests. If the character must make a Composure Test while under fire or in a similar combat situation, the gamemaster applies a +1 threshold modifier.','Negative','Core','',1,'Notoriety:1','',0,''),(155,'Computer Illiterate','7 KARMA','There are characters who aren’t tech-savvy and characters who just don’t understand technology, and then there are characters with this quality. These characters have no experience at working with AR, computers, commlinks, and other electronic devices. They have difficulty performing even simple tasks such as making commcalls, sending e-mails, instant messaging, programming a trideo recorder, using a commlink, or doing a Matrix search. This quality provides a –4 dice pool modifier to all tests that involve a computer, electronic device, or Matrix-connected system of any kind. During stressful or tense situations, the gamemaster may require a Success Test, with the modifier, to complete tasks others would take for granted.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(156,'Creature Of Comfort (Middle)','10 KARMA','For the character with this quality, the rewards of a job well done are the finer things in life.

At the 10 Karma level, the character is used to a Middle Lifestyle, at the 17 level a High, and 25, it’s Luxury all the way, baby.    For every day that the character must spend “slumming” it in a lower Lifestyle category, the irritable character suffers a –1 penalty to all Social and Healing tests per Lifestyle category below his chosen level.

Whenever the character encounters protected files (see the Edit File action, p. 239, SR5), he must succeed in a Composure (3) Test or attempt to Crack the File. The character is allowed to attempt to check if the file has a Data Bomb on it, and if so, to disarm it. However, the character cannot move on with his life until the file has been cracked and downloaded (he can read it later). Even if the character is in the middle of a host with IC trying to kill him and enemy hackers slinging at him, he will stop what he is doing and attempt to get that file.

Whether that’s true or not, having more augmentations does make it more difficult to relate to others. During any Social Test, if the character glitches, they act in an inappropriate manner or violently overreact to their situation. If the character suffers a critical glitch, they suffer a psychotic break, essentially becoming an NPC until such time that the gamemaster decides they’ve recovered.    Note: Characters augmented heavily enough to risk cyberpsychosis may suffer negative social modifiers due to excessive augmentation.

Others would sneer that you won’t last long in this business. And yet many more would kill you on sight for what you’ve done.    The character is compelled to give away for free any gained paydata, intelligence, or secret from any mission they perform. The character simply disseminates the data to news outlets, screamsheets, shadowrunner data boards, etc. To anyone who will listen, really.    If the character was specifically hired to collect data, they may still chose to deliver the data to the buyer as normal, accepting or refusing the fee (player’s discretion). However, they will then immediately disseminate the data widely.    The character is likely to make friends as well as enemies fairly quickly doing this. Consider it playing a character on the “difficult” setting.','Negative','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(161,'Day Job (10 hrs)','5 KARMA','When running in the shadows, sometimes you need a way to fill your days, or to maintain your cover. This quality burdens a character with responsibilities and time commitments. While the regular income is nice, having a regular schedule and a boss to answer to doesn’t jibe well with the shadowrunning profession. The player and gamemaster should work together to determine the job, which is usually a pretty decent gig based on the pay rates, but the gamemaster should determine the shifts the character works. In order to establish the legitimacy of the day job, the character must possess a valid SIN (SINner quality or at least a Rating 4 fake SIN). If they have the SINner quality, the money from the Day Job quality is considered already taxed. If they are using a fake and it gets burned or connected to a crime, expect the cops to come down hard and the job is lost until the situation is cleared up.    When combined with the Fame quality, this could easily bring in enough money to support the character, so make sure they have a good reason to run the shadows.    The Day Job table provides the Karma, income, and hours breakdown for the quality.    During runs, the gamemaster should keep track of how many consecutive days are being spent on shadowrunning activity and whether the character can fulfill their day job responsibilities. If they can’t, they get a warning; if it happens again after a warning, they lose their job. Losing their job costs them 2 points of Street Cred (how can you be trusted as a runner if you can’t even hold a job as a fry cook?) and costs the character a month of salary due to purchases they made in anticipation of their pay.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(162,'Dead Emotion','5 KARMA','The character has abused BTL-level moodsofts and can no longer feel one specific emotion (e.g., happiness, anger, fear) under any circumstances.

Yesterday? A month ago? Or was it always inside you, and you just never noticed? But recently, it has grown. Sometimes, it’s the dissociative thoughts. Mr. Johnson is talking about robbing a data bank, and all you can think about is a longshoreman in an orange jacket. Focusing is hard. Sometimes it’s your makeup. Lipstick on the eyelids, eyeliner around the lips. But mostly, mostly, it’s the Matrix. Everything about it is starting to feel wrong. What others call data, you call broken thoughts masquerading as information. It’s put together wrong. It feels so, so much better when you put it the way it ought to be …    A character with the Decaying Dissonance quality has been infected with Dissonance. This is not a well-understood thing. It’s not exactly a mental illness. It’s not a virus. It’s a state of being, something that changes in one’s core. The character is starting to think that what others call clean and orderly feels wrong, very wrong. They want to see things put together all differently. They want to deconstruct everything, mix the pieces, and put it back in a way that makes sense only to them, and maybe others like them.    This quality manifests in several ways. Whenever the character is in a stressful situation (such as combat), the character’s communications become nonsensical. To restore order to his thoughts, the character must take a Simple Action and succeed in a Composure (2) Test. Success means the character can communicate normally for the rest of the combat. Failure means any attempts to communicate result in gibberish, though the character can understand what others say.    Outside of combat, the character can easily get distracted. This is off-putting to people speaking to him, resulting in a –1 die penalty to all Social Tests. It also affects his ability to remember things. Any glitch on a Memory Test counts as a critical glitch.    Lastly, and perhaps most importantly of all, the technomancer has problems with the way the Matrix is around him, particularly while in hosts. When in a host, the character must pass a Composure (3) Test or start randomly using Edit File on data around him. Data affected in this way becomes gibberish, unreadable to anyone.    This quality can be bought off, but only as part of a Submersion. Eliminating this quality replaces the normally chosen echo.

Dependents may include children, parents, a spouse or lover, a sibling, or an old friend. Meeting the needs of a dependent should take up a fair amount of the character’s time, as well as some of the character’s money. Increase the amount of time it takes to learn a new skill or improve an existing skill by fifty percent. See the Character Advancement section on p. 103 for more information on how long it takes to improve skills. Also increase the base time for any long-term projects by fifty percent. A dependent could also be a hindrance in other ways—getting underfoot, sharing living space, involving herself in the character’s work, borrowing the car, calling at the most inopportune moments, etc.    For 3 Karma, the dependent is an occasional nuisance: dropping in unexpectedly (such as when the character must go to a meet), needing emotional support, favors, or other confirmations of friendship/commitment, and occasionally money. Examples of dependents at this level include: slacker sibling, long-term boyfriend/girlfriend, or a child not living with the character but for whom the character pays child support and visits regularly. Raise the character’s lifestyle cost by 10 percent each month.    For 6 Karma, the dependent is a regular inconvenience: needing attention and commitment on a regular basis, getting involved in the character’s affairs, sharing living space. Examples of dependents at this level include: a live-in lover/wife/husband or family member, a child for whom the character shares custody and routinely has in his home (every other weekend, etc.), or a young child or close sibling for whom the character is responsible. Increase the character’s lifestyle cost by 20 percent each month.    At the 9 Karma level, the dependent is close family or a life partner and lives with the character. The dependent is a strain on the character’s time and resources, and/or requires special care and attention that limits the character’s availability for missions or specific actions. Examples of these dependents include large family sharing the living space, parents or grandparents with medical or physical needs, and full custody of any children. Increase the lifestyle cost for the character by 30 percent each month.','Negative','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(166,'Did You Just Call Me Dumb?','3 KARMA','The character can’t resist camouflaging insults into well-spoken words.

Choices for Distinctive Style include, but are by no means limited to: tattoos that cannot be easily concealed, an accent or atypical manner of speaking, bizarre fashion choices, scars, gang or prison signs, flashy custom augmentations, or non-metahuman modifications like a tail. Note that what’s distinctive in one culture or location may not be in another.    Whatever Distinctive Style the player selects makes her character easy to remember. Anyone who attempts to identify, trace, or physically locate this character (or gain information about him via legwork) receives a +2 dice pool modifier for relevant tests. If an NPC makes a Memory Test (p. 152) to determine how much they recall about the character, reduce the Difficulty Threshold by 1, to a minimum of 1.

This can be finding a disappeared loved one, discovering a hidden truth about themselves, or even getting revenge on an old enemy. Whatever the cause, when faced with a clue or opportunity to advance their quest, the character must make a Willpower + Logic (4) Test to not immediately drop everything and pursue this new information. Unless the character succeeds, they will sacrifice anything and anyone to get closer to the truth. On the other hand, such single-minded obsession makes the character a tough nut to crack.

Any situations that make the fix available require a Composure Test with a threshold based on the stress the character is currently under, starting at 1 for passive situations (offer of a social drink) to 5 for highstress situations (before, during, or right after a major life-threatening situation.) Based on the level of the quality (see below), players receive a 1, 2, 3, or 4 dice pool penalty on any Addiction Tests following the use of the substance they used to abuse to see if they relapse into full addiction again. If they do, this quality disappears and is replaced by the Addiction quality, but the player does not receive any Karma bonus for the change.    The Dry Addict quality includes the following levels, just like addiction: Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Burnout level.

And you believe that, if everyone did the same as you, the world would be a much better place. And hey, you can sell your recordings too, so that’s always good.    With this quality, the character must acquire gear to record video and sound and wear it at all time (cybereyes and cyberears would be perfect, but sensors can otherwise be mounted in gear). This gear must always be on. The character will never turn off wireless functionality on their gear. If the character takes the Day Job quality, then they meet the conditions of the job simply by being, as they then sell the recordings to specialized data brokers and make their money this way. If they opt not to take Day Job, then the character can do what they wish with the recordings.    In any situation where the character cannot record or turns off wifi on his gear, then they feel especially agitated, suffering a –1 dice pool penalty to all actions.','Negative','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(173,'Elf Poser','6 KARMA','The Elf Poser is a human character who wants to be an elf. She associates with elves as much as possible, talks like elves, and alters her appearance to resemble an elf. Characters with this quality may undergo cosmetic surgery to get elf ears and elf eyes, and they may successfully pass as elves and avoid any negative Social modifiers associated with being a non-elf.    Real elves consider Elf Posers an embarrassment, many humans think of them as sellouts, and other metatypes generally consider posers to be pathetic. If an elf discovers the character’s secret, the elf is likely to treat her with contempt and hostility (see Social Modifiers Table, p. 140). An outed elf poser may also face stigma from prejudiced humans as a “race traitor.”    Only human characters may take the Elf Poser quality.','Negative','Core','',1,'Notoriety:1','',0,''),(174,'Emotional Attachment','5 KARMA','The character has an irrational emotional attachment to a piece of gear. The character will always use this item, even if presented with a “better” option. Furthermore, if lost in some manner, the character will do everything in his power, up to and including risking his life and that of his teammates, to retrieve his item. If the piece of gear is irretrievably lost or damaged, the player must either immediately spend Karma to buy off the quality or suffer a –1 penalty on all tests that would have used that piece of gear for a six-month period. After that time, they learn to love a replacement piece of gear, and the quality transfers to that item.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(175,'Ex-con','15 KARMA','Runners often brag that they’d go down in a blaze of glory before they let the pawns bring them down. The prison system is full of them. A character with this quality is fresh out of the joint and still on the legal leash, so they have several drawbacks.    First, the local police corporation has a full file and rundown on the character, including augmentations, magical training, known associates, biometric data, a material link, etc. This file is duplicated by the local prison corporation if they are different than the police force and is connected to their nice new Criminal SIN (sorry, no extra points there). Plus, the character cannot have any Restricted or Forbidden augmentations, as the prison system removes them to protect the other inmates and staff (and sell them to the black market).    Second, the character is on parole and has to check in with their parole officer (PO) twice a week via the Matrix and once a week in person. Plus, the PO can choose to make a house call any time they want. Whether the gamemaster wants the character to have a sleazy or a squeaky clean PO is up to them, but each creates their own bundle of problems.    Third, the character is known to be an ex-con and is limited in their choice of contacts. Street-level folks will still freely associate with the runner—hell, they might even commiserate while waiting in their mutual PO’s waiting room. Corp contacts will only associate with the character if they have a Loyalty Rating of 4 or higher, and law enforcement contacts only stick by the runner if they have a Loyalty Rating of 5 or 6.    If the character ever gets past their parole or creates a new life for him- or herself, this quality must be bought off or replaced with other negative qualities of equal or greater value.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(176,'Faceless','6 KARMA','You have worn disguises so frequently and for so long that being out in public wearing your real face makes you feel vulnerable. You suffer a –2 dice pool modifer on Social tests unless your face is disguised or otherwise concealed. It does not matter if this disguise is magical or mundane, just that you are unrecognizable.

Maybe it’s your cyberware, causing interference. Whatever it is, you are a bit of a problem. Whenever you are near, the static on the line goes up. Anyone within ten meters of you (including yourself) suffers +2 Noise. This noise can be reduced in the normal way and is cumulative with whatever noise penalties would normally apply. It is worth noting that anyone outside of the ten meters who is attempting to connect to you (including attempts to hack you) do not suffer this extra noise penalty.','Negative','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(179,'Flashbacks I','7 KARMA','Whether due to PTSD, mental torture, psychotropic IC, or just a scarring experience, the character suffers vivid memory-based sensory hallucinations. The flashbacks are triggered by a specific stimulus. Whenever the character encounters their trigger stimulus, they must make a Composure (5) Test or become incapacitated for (5 – hits) Combat Turns. During the flashback, the character is unable to perform any useful action and may instead perform physical actions reflecting their mental misperceptions.    During character creation, work with the gamemaster to determine the stimulus and Karma value based on how common that stimulus will be in the campaign. The stimulus can be any sensory input, including something on the astral plane or in the Matrix. A 7 Karma stimulus should come up about once every other shadowrun, while the 15 Karma stimulus should pop up at least once in every game session.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(180,'Gremlins','4 KARMA PER RATING','Characters with the Gremlins quality don’t get along with technology. Devices malfunction inexplicably, software crashes unexpectedly, vehicles refuse to start, components become unusually fragile at his touch, and wireless links suffer faltering connections and odd interference whenever he’s involved.    For each Rating (maximum of 4), reduce the number of rolled 1s necessary to get a glitch (p. 45) by 1 whenever the character is attempting to use a moderately sophisticated device. For example, a character with a dice pool of 8 and Gremlins level 2 (8 Karma) would trigger a glitch if two or more 1s result from the test (instead of the normal 4). The gamemaster may also require the character to make a test for operation that would otherwise succeed automatically to see whether or not a glitch occurs.    When describing the effects of a Gremlin-induced glitch, gamemasters should play up the notion of a particularly weird mechanical or electronics malfunction. Some examples of Gremlin-induced glitches include: the magazine falling out of a pistol when attempting a critical shot, a keypad inexplicably burning out while entering a code to disarm an alarm system, or the commlink interface converting to Sperethiel mid-sentence when attempting to access a restricted node.    Note that Gremlins is a Negative quality—its effects hinder the character (and probably entertain others). The character cannot use his Gremlins quality to damage an opponent’s high-tech equipment merely by touching it. Anything the character attempts to sabotage using only Gremlins will function flawlessly. (Obviously, he can try any ordinary means of sabotage, but Gremlins will haunt his efforts.)    The effect only applies to external equipment and does not affect cyberware, bioware, or other implants.','Negative','Core','',4,'','',0,''),(181,'Hobo With A Shotgun','10 KARMA','The character has survived on the streets for so long that anything else makes them distrustful and suspicious. The character will not choose to stay in accommodations above Squatter. If, for example, the team elects to spend the night in a Middle Lifestyle hotel, or even a squalid Low Lifestyle motel, the character will walk out and find a comfortable alley to sleep in rather than bear this “luxury.” If forced to stay somewhere above Squatter, the character will be at –2 to all his Mental attributes as he becomes confused, erratic, and agitated until such a time as he is able to spend a day in a Squatter or Street lifestyle to rezone himself.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(182,'Hung Out To Dry','8 KARMA','Welcome to the world of social shunning. For some reason, unknown to the character, her contacts have suddenly clammed up and stopped answering her calls, and new connections she makes suddenly dry up when they get wind of her social pariah status. The gamemaster knows the reason no one will talk to her, and it’s up to the character to try to figure it out and maybe clear her name. These events could be the focus of an entire campaign or just a few side-jobs here and there that the character might need to convince her running mates to help her out on.    If other members of the team start to ask around as to why the character is on the outs, their contacts may get a little tight-lipped and may even clam up until the situation is resolved. Once the situation is resolved, the character will need to either buy off this quality or replace it with another of equal value as a result of the events.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(183,'Illiterate','5 KARMA','Though literacy is not really necessary thanks to the advances of the Sixth World, most folks can at least sound out “See Spot run.” Whether because she grew up in the wild (urban, rural, or otherwise), or just never had the opportunity, the character cannot read a lick. She can ask others, use an agent program, or get software on her commlink to scan and read things aloud, but anyone aware of this intellectual deficit will look negatively on the character, reducing her Social Limit by 1. The illiterate character also suffers a –2 dice pool modifier when working with computer/commlink systems and electronics other than her own due to her unfamiliarity with their iconography. Also, during character creation the character cannot choose any Knowledge skill that may have required even the most minimal of reading, and during game play all Knowledge skills that require reading cost double the Karma for the character until she learns to read and buys off this quality.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(184,'Impassive','7 KARMA','Nobody can see as much death as you have and not have it affect them.

The demands of their augmented biologies and the body’s continuous attempts to adjust to the implants can lead to decreased immunity to pathogens, poisons, and other compounds. Characters with this quality suffer a dice pool modifier of –2 on all Body Tests to resist the effects of diseases, drugs, toxins, and other compounds (including Physical Addiction Tests and Disease Resistance Tests). This quality is only available to characters with bioware or cyberware implants and an Essence of 5 or less.','Negative','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(186,'In Debt','1 KARMA PER RATING','Whether it came betting the ponies or buying that new pony, the character owes money to an unsavory third party. The player and gamemaster must work out the details, but the happy thing is, for every point of(up to 15) spent to be In Debt, the character gets 5,000 nuyen to spend during character creation. These points are spent in place of the normal Karma for extra cash and extend the possible additional funds to 75,000¥.    Now it’s time for the bad news. The character now owes some nasty people the amount they borrowed, plus another fifty percent, and the amount increases by ten percent every month until it’s paid off. If the character misses a monthly payment, which has to be at least the interest for the month, they take 1 box of Physical damage for every 20,000 nuyen they owe. This can’t be resisted and can’t be healed until they pay their minimum as their friendly neighborhood lender sent the appropriate message and then leans on them until they get their money. They can also expect to be asked to do some discount work and maybe even a few favors while they have the debt hanging over their head.    The quality can be bought off if the character has both enough Karma and cash to pay the debt. If they only have the cash but not the Karma, they can trade for another negative quality of equal Karma. If they don’t want to do that, then the lenders suddenly become scarce, and the character is unable to make the payment until interest compounds again, leaving them deeper in debt.','Negative','SR5:RF','',15,'','',0,''),(187,'Incompetent','5 KARMA','An Incompetent character possesses a total lack of knowledge or ability with a certain Active skill group—or, perhaps worse, they have some vague knowledge or the skills contained in the group, but they have neither the coordination nor the comprehension to come anywhere close to carrying it off properly. No matter how much effort they put into this area, they simply cannot grasp it—it would take a miracle for them to somehow, someday advance to the level of “poor” in those skills.    Incompetent may not be applied to Language or Knowledge skills. The Incompetent character is treated as having skill level of “unaware” for all skills in the skill group (see the Skill Rating Table, p. 131).    In some cases, a Success Test may be required for tasks most people take for granted. Characters may not possess that skill group for which they have the Incompetent quality. If gear grants a bonus or requires the use of a specific skill in which the character is Incompetent, the character gains no benefits from the gear.    Gamemasters are free to reject any choices that would prove irrelevant or exploitative in actual play, such as Incompetent: Outdoors in a campaign based entirely inside an arcology. (This should go without saying, but just in case: Characters may never choose Incompetent for any skill group that they are physically incapable of using. A non-magician cannot take Incompetent in Sorcery, Conjuring, or Enchanting; a non-technomancer cannot be Incompetent in a skill that requires Resonance; and so on.)    Incompetent may be purchased only once.','Negative','Core','',1,'Notoriety:1','',0,''),(188,'Incomplete Deprogramming','10 KARMA','Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don’t. A character with this quality was once mentally programmed to be a deep-cover agent for an agency. When they left, their deprogramming wasn’t completed properly for some reason. Since then the character has had occasional, often unexpected, shifts back to their cover identity.    Whenever this character faces a stressful situation such as an interrogation, combat, or even just an injury, they must make a Composure (4) Test. Failure means the cover identity comes out and takes control for either 1D6 minutes or whatever length of time the gamemaster desires. The altered psychological state is not stable, though, and another stressful situation can call for another Composure (4) Test and another personality shift. This can occur over and over during the same firefight.    During these states the character forgets their badass runner identity and the skills that go with it, and they turn back into mild-mannered everyday Joe. This includes loss of skills while the cover identity is in charge. The gamemaster can create a secondary character for the player to use during these times, ask them to step out while they run the NPC, or make them sit and watch in humiliation as their character screams like a child and runs for cover or simply wanders up to the guard booth, seemingly lost in the middle of the secure facility.    As if all of this wasn’t bad enough, behaviors like this look an awful lot like CFD, and people are going to start wondering if you’re a head case.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(189,'Infirm','5 KARMA PER RATING','Characters with this quality often think, “I should hit the gym” but rarely get past buying the membership, or they’re on the downward slope of life and just too old for this drek. The quality represents some kind of diminished physical fitness aptitude. For every 5 Karma, the character drops all of their Physical Attribute maximums by one. The quality can be taken up to five times, but no Attribute maximum can be dropped below 1. Along with this natural cap, the character can never have a Physical Attribute modified beyond this maximum by any source—magic, machine or otherwise—as their body is too frail to handle the stress.    The effects of this quality stack with those of the Aged quality from Bullets & Bandages (p. 12), so characters need to be careful of not dropping any Attribute maximum lower than one.','Negative','SR5:RF','',5,'','',0,''),(190,'Insomnia (Basic)','10 KARMA','A character with the Insomnia quality has trouble falling asleep and seldom feels well rested. Usually, this is only an annoyance. For runners, however, this can become a major problem when they are dependent on being able to rest at every opportunity to remain sharp. Insomnia can lengthen the amount of time it takes for a character to recover Stun damage.    At the 10 Karma level, before a character rolls his Body + Willpower to recover Stun damage, the character rolls an Intuition + Willpower (4) Test. If the character succeeds on this test, the character is not impeded by Insomnia and the character regains Stun damage as normal. He also regains 1 point of Edge after 8 hours of restful sleep. If the character fails, double the amount of time it normally would take for a character to recover their Stun damage. So instead of healing a number of boxes of Stun damage in an hour, it now takes two hours per roll. If the character is affected by Insomnia, the character does not have his Edge refreshed and may not have it refreshed for up to another 24 hours.    At the 15 Karma level, a failed Willpower + Intuition (4) Test means that all efforts to regain Stun damage through rest are negated during that time period, and the character must try again later. No Stun damage is regained from the attempt due to the insomnia the character experiences, and the character must wait for 24 hours before their Edge refreshes.','Negative','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(191,'Lack Of Focus','6 KARMA','Characters suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have difficulty focusing on a single subject for long. When making any Extended Test with an interval greater than five minutes and shorter than one day, or if repeated simple tests are made within a period of time (such as Perception Tests during surveillance), the character must make a Composure (3) Test each interval after the first. The character’s Composure dice pool is cumulatively reduced by 1 for each of these tests, like any other Extended Test.    Failing the Composure Test indicates the character can no longer focus and must take a break for a minimum of 1 interval, plus any other consequences that result. After the break, the character’s Composure dice pool is refreshed, and the process starts over again.','Negative','SR5:CF','',1,'','',0,''),(192,'Latest And Greatest','5 KARMA','The character just loves her tech. Really, really loves it. That is, until something better comes along. After all, the problem with getting things is that you get something you used to want, right? The character has an unstoppable desire to upgrade her gear. Every month, she must upgrade or buy a more expensive version of one of her most commonly used pieces of gear. For example, a hacker would seek to upgrade her deck or commlink. A street samurai would get a better, more expensive assault rifle, or, of course, cyber upgrades—such as the next highest rating of cybereyes with more accessories in it. Magic-users would want higher-rating focus or lodge. If all else fails, moving up to the next Lifestyle bracket is always an option.    The character must spend at least sixty percent of her earnings on these upgrades. It is possible to earmark earnings for a specific purchase down the road if she’s saving up for a particularly shiny new toy, but this money is unavailable to the character until then.','Negative','SR5:DT','',1,'','',0,''),(193,'Leeeeeeeroy Jenkins','20 KARMA','Planning is not your strong suit. Following other people’s plans is not your strong suit. Rushing in swinging with both fists is the only plan you ever need.    The character must succeed in a Composure (3) Test to resist attacking any identified threat immediately. This attack can be conducted using any Combat skills, any Direct or Indirect Damage spell, drones that can be directed to attack the target, or assaults against the target’s persona or gear using any Matrix or Resonance action that causes Matrix, Stun, or Physical damage.    The character doesn’t care if the odds are against him, the attack is downright suicidal or just plain stupid: they will attack. Crucially, they will also not bother sharing their attack plan (such as it is) with their teammates.    The character can, however, recognize they are in a losing situation and back out of the fight, but only after a minimum of 2 Combat Turns have passed.    If the character roars his or her name as a Free Action right before the first blow is struck, they gain +1 die to their first attack.

Everyone around knows the character to be a compulsive liar, and even when she manages to utter the truth, she just sounds false and insincere. Let’s look at how this plays out. First, the character receives a –1 dice pool modifier to all Social skill tests. Also, whenever the character addresses someone, the gamemaster rolls 1D6. On a result of 1, the target of the conversation calls bullshit and assumes the character is lying, no matter what they are saying. Trust is lost, conversation is over. This occurs with every conversation the character takes part in. Any NPC who lost trust in the character this way continues to maintain a certain level of mistrust, and the next time they encounter the character, things go wrong on a roll of 1 or 2. If it happens a third time, the character gains a point of Notoriety, and reduces the Loyalty value of the contact by 1 (if it was a contact). If that means they hit Loyalty 0, then say sayonara to that contact.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(195,'Lightweight','6 KARMA','On the bright side, this quality means it’s easy, and cheap, to get drunk. On the downside, it takes far less to get a person addicted to the various types of chemical drugs on the market.

Though a skilled decker, he failed to hack into a Stuffer Shack host, or despite high Agility, he glitched an easy Climbing Test and fell into a dumpster—whatever the reason, he now doubts himself and his abilities. In tests involving the affected skill, the character suffers a –2 dice pool modifier. If the character has a specialization with the skill, the character cannot use that specialization while suffering a loss of confidence. The skill chosen for the character to have a Loss of Confidence must be one that the character prides himself in and has invested in building. Only skills with a rating 4 or higher may suffer the Loss of Confidence quality. Edge may not be used for tests involving this skill when the character is suffering Loss of Confidence.','Negative','Core','',1,'','',0,''),(197,'Low Pain Tolerance','9 KARMA','Characters with Low Pain Tolerance are particularly sensitive to pain; they incur a –1 wound modifier for every 2 boxes of cumulative damage, instead of the normal 3 boxes.

Once the vehicle movement drops, the Nausea disappears in (12 – Body) minutes.','Negative','SR5:R5.0','',1,'','',0,''),(199,'Nerdrage','8 KARMA','This character is a little more comfortable with machines than other individuals. Whenever the character fails a Social Test—whether he initiated it, or was the target of one—the character takes it extremely personally and feels deeply humiliated about the encounter. They subsequently build bitter feelings against the individual (if it was a group of people, the bitterness targets the formal or nominal leader of the group). Distracted by their shame and rage, the character starts suffering a –2 dice penalty to all Social Tests. However, the character can remove this penalty by getting back at the target character by gaining 1 mark on their commlink and performing an Edit File action on it to deface it. The character does not need to perform this themselves—anyone doing this on their behalf is a-okay with them.    The character must “get back” at all characters that humiliated them before losing the dice penalty. If the character is able to confirm the target is now dead (such as by putting a bullet in their head themselves), then that works too.

Plus, affected individuals can masquerade as healthy people for a significant period of time before being detected. Is it any wonder the world is feeling a little paranoid these days?    Unfortunately for you, word on the street is that you are a head case, as CFD-inflicted individuals are colloquially known. No amount of reasoning has thus far convinced your friends and acquaintances that these are baseless rumors—everyone is convinced you’re crawling with CFD. Bummer.    While this quality can be bought off with Karma as per normal rules, until this happens, all of your Contacts believe you’re afflicted with CFD. None will agree to meet you in the flesh for fear of being infected. If you drop in on them in person unexpectedly, they will either fight you or flee from your presence.

Ork posers are an embarrassment to many orks, but some tolerate, if not appreciate, the compliment behind the effort. This means an ork who discovers the character’s secret may either become very hostile toward him or be willing to let the character join the “family”—provided he passes an appropriate hazing ritual to prove his “orkness.” An outed ork poser may also face stigma from other humans or elves as “race traitors,” if those humans/elves harbor any prejudice against orks.

The character will not participate in runs involving wetwork and may try to dissuade other team members from doing so. Non-lethal attacks (gel rounds, tasers, flash-bangs, stun spells, etc.) are still considered “violent,” and may only be used in self-defense—after an opponent has clearly attacked the character, other team members, or innocent bystanders.    At the 15 Karma level, the character will not commit any violence regardless of provocation or threat to themselves or others. If the character commits any act of violence they are stricken with a powerful sense of guilt and suffer a –1 dice pool modifier to all tests involving Mental attributes until the character succeeds at a Charisma + Willpower (20, 1 day) Extended Test. If the character does not succeed at the test within seven days, they lose 1 point of Willpower or Charisma, whichever is higher. The loss is permanent, but the –1 dice pool modifier to tests involving Mental attributes goes away.

They have trouble, though, with stairs and curbs, which can prevent them from getting where they need to go.    The paralysis can be permanent or a temporary condition while the character builds up funds to get surgery to fix the cause. Once the repair is done, the quality has to be bought off. The character has a lot of additional expenses to make the world more manageable. To reflect this, their Lifestyle cost is increased by 10 percent (cumulative with racial modifiers) and vehicles need to be modified, increasing their price by 5 percent, or have a Rigger Interface (p. 461, SR5) for DNI control.

Depending upon the degree of prejudice, this quality can get the character into trouble for expressing his views or when forced to confront the targets of his prejudice.    The Karma bonus granted by this quality varies depending upon how common the hated group is, how often the character is likely to encounter members of the group, and the degree to which the character is openly antagonistic toward them. Refer to the Prejudiced Table to determine the Karma value of the quality based on the prevalence of the hated group and the degree of prejudice.    When dealing with the target of their prejudice, a character receives a –2 dice pool modifier per level of severity of the Prejudiced quality for all Social Tests. If negotiations are a part of the encounter, the target receives a +2 modifier per level of the Prejudiced quality.

A character with a reduced sense of smell or taste gains 2 Karma, while a reduced sense of hearing, sight, or astral sight is worth 5 Karma, and a reduced sense of touch is worth 10 Karma because it affects most Physical skill rolls due to lack of tactile sensitivity.    If the sense is ever repaired or corrected permanently, the quality must be bought off. If the character does not have enough Karma to buy off the quality, the intended repair cannot be made.

The problem can manifest as short- or long-term memory loss, unexpected blackouts, frequent migraines, diminished senses (sight, touch, smell, etc.), and mood disorders such as paranoia and anxiety. The player chooses one specific effect of Scorched, and its effect should be pronounced enough to hinder the character and present potential plot hooks for the gamemaster. Whenever he enters VR or slots a BTL chip, the character must make a Body + Willpower (4) Test. On a failed roll, he experiences the specified physical effects for six hours. A glitch or critical glitch on this test results in suffering the effects for 24 hours. The only way to eliminate the Scorched quality is to get the medical treatment necessary to repair the damage, then spend the Karma to buy off the Negative quality. Once Scorched, though, the character remains susceptible to the condition. Another bad encounter with Black or Psychotropic IC or a BTL will bring this quality back. In addition to the physical side effects the character may experience from being Scorched, the character is vulnerable to damage inflicted by either Black or Psychotropic IC or BTLs. When faced with this IC, the character must make a Willpower (3) Test to be able to confront it without panicking. If he is able to confront the IC that caused their Scorched condition, the character suffers a –2 to Damage Resistance Tests when these programs are inflicting damage.    To take the Scorched quality for BTLs, the character must have at least a Mild Addiction to BTLs and possess the gear necessary to use BTLs.

This quality works differently for characters who are technomancers or Awakened and therefore never plan to take implants. Awakened individuals or technomancers remain fully capable of channeling mana or using Resonance, but they are potentially more susceptible to Drain or Fading. A magic user or technomancer with a Sensitive System must make a Willpower (2) Test before any Drain or Fading Tests.

This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.  At the 5 Karma level, the character has what is called a National SIN. The character’s parents were legal citizens of a nation (such as the UCAS or CAS) and he has been a citizen of that nation from birth. He has the right to vote, qualify for passports issued by his nation, enlist in the national military, or work in the national government. A National SIN is required for any national security clearance or any form of national military career. A character with a National SIN pays fifteen percent of their gross income in taxes. He is also in no way connected to any of the megacorporations. The main drawback to having a legal National SIN is the character is in the system. The nation in the player character’s background has the character’s biometric data (DNA, fingerprints, retinal scans) on file, and that biometric data is shared with law enforcement agencies through the Global SIN Registry. This makes it much easier to track a character should a job go sideways. Also, nations typically sell the personal information tied to the character’s SIN to corporations. Those with a legal SIN get nearly three times as much spam as those who don’t have a SIN or rely on fake SINs, and the spam messages they receive are disturbingly tailored to their preferences (based on their buying and browsing habits).','Negative','Core','',1,'','',1,''),(227,'Sinner (Criminal)','10 KARMA','There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born.

This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.  At the 10 Karma level, the character has a Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National); his Criminal SIN replaces any previous SIN. At some point in his life, the character was arrested and served time for a felony-level offense and was branded a criminal for the rest of his life. He is legally required to broadcast his Criminal SIN at all times; failure to do so is a felony and can lead to re-incarceration. He is shunned by law-abiding society. Law-abiding citizens will, if they must, deal with a SINless character before they’d have any interaction with a known criminal. With his Criminal SIN, the character will experience prejudiced views, suspicion, and/or open hostility from most people with SINs. He will often be denied entry to certain locations (high-end stores, car dealerships, museums, galleries, etc.) and will have difficulty finding legal employment. He can expect to be brought in and held up to 48 hours for questioning anytime a crime is committed in his area. The judicial system in 2075 is more an assembly line than institution of justice. Suspects are treated as guilty unless proven innocent, plausible circumstantial evidence is often sufficient for conviction, and sentencing has more to do with the judge’s mood than the crime. In this environment it’s likely the cops will be more interested in closing the case than solving any crime; they may try to pin crimes on the character with the Criminal SIN whether or not she had anything to do with it. Some degree of “adjusting” facts and “interpreting” witness accounts to support allegations is common; fabricating evidence, if only to meet conviction productivity goals, is not rare. Magic users tend to receive much harsher treatment from the judicial system than mundane criminals. If the character is a magic user with a Criminal SIN, he is registered with local law enforcement. He can expect regular—but usually not scheduled—checks to confirm he lives and to ensure he is not using forbidden spell formula, foci, or other magical gear. The nation or corporation that issued the Criminal SIN will keep close tabs on the character, if he fails to update residential information or appears in any way to be trying to evade their oversight, he is subject to arrest. He is also required to pay a fifteen percent tax on his gross income to the entity that issued his Criminal SIN.','Negative','Core','',1,'Notoriety:1','',1,''),(228,'Sinner (Corporate Limited)','15 KARMA','There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born.

This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.  At the 15 Karma level the character has the Corporate Limited SIN; he has somehow gained a position in a megacorporation from the outside. He may have been hired as a wageslave (or been the minor child of a person hired as a wageslave), or perhaps brought in by someone in the megacorp who saw advantage in his skill, talent, area of expertise, or some other useful attribute. Under most circumstances the Corporate Limited SIN replaces any National SIN. His Corporate Limited SIN becomes part of the Global SIN Registry, to which law enforcement agencies and security corporations alike have access. Many of these Corporate Limited SINs record whether or not the character is Awakened. The Corporate Limited SIN allows the character to be employed by the megacorp under most circumstances, and it replaces any National SIN that the character may have had previously. With the Corporate SIN, the character can be gainfully employed by the issuing megacorporation as a wageslave, a low-ranking member of the corporation’s security services, or an enlisted member of the corporation’s military. Though he could have a secret-level security clearance to perform his duties, he cannot rise to a leadership position, become an officer, or be part of the megacorporation’s Special Forces (such as the Red Samurai). As a group, characters that possess Corporate Limited SINs are believed to either know something valuable about the inner workings of the megacorporation or have a skill set rival megacorps would want; as such they are considered valid targets for extraction, even if they are no longer active with the corporation. Characters with the Corporate Limited SIN experience prejudice and hostility from those in the shadows who are SINless. The SINless believe the corporations deliberately keep them poor and powerless so they can be exploited. The character with the Corporate Limited SIN may find himself being personally blamed for his corporation’s actions—protesting he has no real authority and no connection with the actions in question usually does little good. To the SINless and neo-anarchists the character with the Corporate Limited SIN has sold out and chosen a corrupt and oppressive system over his own people.

This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.  At the 25 Karma level is the Corporate Born SIN. The character with this ID was probably born into a mega corporation, or belonged to one when it achieved extraterritoriality. At least one of his parents probably had the Corporate Born SIN as well. He grew up in the corporation, his social involvement, education, and almost every aspect of his life was managed by the corporation. His skills and aptitudes were evaluated constantly, and he was groomed for the career path to which he was best suited; his whole world was the corporation. Characters with the Corporate Born SIN had the potential and the opportunity to advance through the corporation hierarchy. He could have been a department administrator, a finance strategist, an agent of corporate intelligence, an officer in a megacorp’s military, or even a member of Corporate Special Forces (Renraku’s Red Samurai or Ares’ Firewatch). With a Corporate Born SIN, he could have enjoyed top-secret clearance within the corporation and access to nearly unlimited resources. Then something happened. An unforgivably costly mistake, the machinations of a rival, a supervisor in need of a scapegoat—something pushed the character out of the corporation and into the cold and unforgiving shadows. In the shadows a SIN that had been the key to opportunity is now a deadly liability. Most in the shadows see the Corporate Born as the privileged few, the aristocrats in the armored limousines who look down on them, oppress them, exploit them and deny them their basic rights. If the SINless discover the character’s Corporate Born SIN, reactions will range from deep suspicion to violent hostility; serious injury and death are real possibilities. The character’s loyalty to his corporation is never questioned, which can be an insurmountable liability in a culture that works against the megacorps. Would-be runners have been killed for holding Corporate Born SINs. Fortunately, Corporate Born records are limited to the megacorporation that generated them. Files in the Global SIN Registry can confirm she has a valid SIN, but do not contain any additional information.

While the character is encouraged to use drugs such as cram, deepweed, and so on (using the description to determine if it’s an upper/stimulant or a downer), this is not strictly necessary, as the character can be assumed to be on generic upper/downer pharmaceuticals. Generic downers cause –1 Reaction and +1 Logic, while uppers cause +1 Reaction and –1 Logic.    In any case, the effect of this quality is that the character must decide whether she is “up” or “down” ahead of time. It takes thirty minutes to switch between conditions. Having the wrong mood at the wrong time can cause embarrassing social issues (for example, being on an up mood while at an oyabun’s beloved son’s funeral, or being down in basically any combat situation).    If the character has the wrong mood at the wrong time, they incur a –2 penalty to all Social Tests.

For example, if his Social Stress is caused by survivor’s guilt after the loss of a close friend, unexpectedly encountering someone who looks similar to the lost friend will heighten stress. When a character is using Leadership or Etiquette skills, reduce the number of 1s required to glitch the test by 1.

If spirits of this type are ordered to attack a party that includes the character, these spirits will single her out and attempt to destroy her first. Affected spirits will always use lethal force against these characters with the Spirit Bane quality. If the character with Spirit Bane tries to summon or bind this spirit, she suffers a –2 dice pool modifier for the attempt. If the summoner tries to banish a spirit of this type, the spirit receives a +2 dice pool modifier for resisting her attempt.

And if you’re more human than human, what are they? Does a person that steps on ants feel bad? If not, then why should you feel anything toward these lesser beings of the old human race? So slow, so weak, so dim.    Characters with superhuman strengths, such as those granted by augmentations, or Awakened powers, can start to feel detached from the human race. They start seeing everyone else kind of like cattle. Like playing a game on the easy mode, the challenges of life seem dim and uninteresting. Characters suffering from Superhuman Psychosis seek out others like them, to belong but also to test themselves, to see how far they can go, how far they can push themselves.    Superhuman Psychosis causes a few effects. The character has absolutely no moral qualms about killing people, seeing it as his right. They won’t go out of their way to kill people, but also won’t hesitate to kill anyone, even going up to mass murder—they just don’t value the lives of lesser beings.    In addition, the character’s general lack of concern for others (and their bullets) makes them pretty formidable in combat. This quality grants an automatic +1 die bonus in melee combat. The character is also less perturbed about puny mortals flinging lead at him, and so suffers only half the penalty from incoming Suppressive Fire.    This is balanced by the fact that they have difficulty disguising their contempt for others, leading to a –2 penalty on all Etiquette and Leadership tests.    When facing opponents equivalent to Professional Rating 5 or above, however, the character gets interested. This is a true test of their skills, and they won’t want to back down. The character must make a Composure (3) Test to withdraw from a fight with such opponents, regardless of the situation. If they fail the test, they must continue the combat.

All Social Tests made by the character to resist acting improperly or impulsively receive a –2 dice pool modifier. Additionally, the cost for learning or improving Social Skills is double for Uncouth characters (including at character creation), and they may never learn any Social skill groups.

Characters with the Uneducated quality are considered “unaware” in Technical, Academic Knowledge, and Professional Knowledge skills they do not possess (see Skill Ratings, p. 129), and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. The gamemaster may also require the character to make Success Tests for ordinary tasks that the typical sprawl-dweller takes for granted.

The condition could be physiological (an untreated genetic disorder or damaged nerves, for example), caused by psychological trauma, or even be symptomatic of age. Certain augmentations or medications can mask these symptoms under normal circumstances. Under more stressful situations in the course of the run, there is a chance the Unsteady Hands condition can reappear. The character makes an Agility + Body (4) Test following a stressful encounter (combat, for example). A successful test means the character does not experience the symptoms of this condition (this time).

Whenever the character encounters the target of her ire, she must make a Composure (3) Test or else have no choice but to incite a violent confrontation.

The bounty should be worth at least 25,000 nuyen, enough to tempt even one’s own “friends.” The character should have to frequently deal with someone coming for them or finding out about the bounty and using it against them.

If Natural Immunity is purchased at the full 10 Karma level, the character is immune to a single, synthetic (artificially created) disease or toxin. Natural Immunity does not affect diseases or toxins that are magically based, such as HMHVV.  The player and gamemaster must agree on the disease, drug, or poison to which the character is immune. The character can take one dose of the drug or poison and experience one exposure to the disease every six hours with no ill effects.

Usually, this is only an annoyance. For runners, however, this can become a major problem when they are dependent on being able to rest at every opportunity to remain sharp. Insomnia can lengthen the amount of time it takes for a character to recover Stun damage.    At the 10 Karma level, before a character rolls his Body + Willpower to recover Stun damage, the character rolls an Intuition + Willpower (4) Test. If the character succeeds on this test, the character is not impeded by Insomnia and the character regains Stun damage as normal. He also regains 1 point of Edge after 8 hours of restful sleep. If the character fails, double the amount of time it normally would take for a character to recover their Stun damage. So instead of healing a number of boxes of Stun damage in an hour, it now takes two hours per roll. If the character is affected by Insomnia, the character does not have his Edge refreshed and may not have it refreshed for up to another 24 hours.    At the 15 Karma level, a failed Willpower + Intuition (4) Test means that all efforts to regain Stun damage through rest are negated during that time period, and the character must try again later.

Albinism is a genetic disorder that results in a partial or complete lack of pigmentation in the eyes, skin, and hair.

Due to the lack of melanin, the compound that provides the pigmentation, characters with this quality lack ultraviolet light protection, making them very photosensitive and prone to sunburn.

The character will not participate in runs involving wetwork and may try to dissuade other team members from doing so. Non-lethal attacks (gel rounds, tasers, flash-bangs, stun spells, etc.) are still considered “violent,” and may only be used in self-defense—after an opponent has clearly attacked the character, other team members, or innocent bystanders.    At the 15 Karma level, the character will not commit any violence regardless of provocation or threat to themselves or others. If the character commits any act of violence they are stricken with a powerful sense of guilt and suffer a –1 dice pool modifier to all tests involving Mental attributes until the character succeeds at a Charisma + Willpower (20, 1 day) Extended Test. If the character does not succeed at the test within seven days, they lose 1 point of Willpower or Charisma, whichever is higher. The loss is permanent, but the –1 dice pool modifier to tests involving Mental attributes goes away. If the character actually kills someone (or even thinks they did), the dice pool modifier becomes –2, the Extended Test interval changes to 1 week, and the character’s Mental Limit is decreased by 1.','Negative','SR5:RF','',1,'','',0,''),(291,'Dependent (Inconvenience)','6 KARMA','A character with the Dependents quality has one or more loved ones who depend on them for emotional support and financial aid. Dependents may include children, parents, a spouse or lover, a sibling, or an old friend. Meeting the needs of a dependent should take up a fair amount of the character’s time, as well as some of the character’s money. Increase the amount of time it takes to learn a new skill or improve an existing skill by fifty percent. See the Character Advancement section on p. 103 for more information on how long it takes to improve skills. Also increase the base time for any long-term projects by fifty percent. A dependent could also be a hindrance in other ways—getting underfoot, sharing living space, involving herself in the character’s work, borrowing the car, calling at the most inopportune moments, etc.    For 3 Karma, the dependent is an occasional nuisance: dropping in unexpectedly (such as when the character must go to a meet), needing emotional support, favors, or other confirmations of friendship/commitment, and occasionally money. Examples of dependents at this level include: slacker sibling, long-term boyfriend/girlfriend, or a child not living with the character but for whom the character pays child support and visits regularly. Raise the character’s lifestyle cost by 10 percent each month.    For 6 Karma, the dependent is a regular inconvenience: needing attention and commitment on a regular basis, getting involved in the character’s affairs, sharing living space. Examples of dependents at this level include: a live-in lover/wife/husband or family member, a child for whom the character shares custody and routinely has in his home (every other weekend, etc.), or a young child or close sibling for whom the character is responsible. Increase the character’s lifestyle cost by 20 percent each month.    At the 9 Karma level, the dependent is close family or a life partner and lives with the character. The dependent is a strain on the character’s time and resources, and/or requires special care and attention that limits the character’s availability for missions or specific actions.

This quality burdens a character with responsibilities and time commitments. While the regular income is nice, having a regular schedule and a boss to answer to doesn’t jibe well with the shadowrunning profession. The player and gamemaster should work together to determine the job, which is usually a pretty decent gig based on the pay rates, but the gamemaster should determine the shifts the character works. In order to establish the legitimacy of the day job, the character must possess a valid SIN (SINner quality or at least a Rating 4 fake SIN). If they have the SINner quality, the money from the Day Job quality is considered already taxed. If they are using a fake and it gets burned or connected to a crime, expect the cops to come down hard and the job is lost until the situation is cleared up.    When combined with the Fame quality, this could easily bring in enough money to support the character, so make sure they have a good reason to run the shadows.    The Day Job table provides the Karma, income, and hours breakdown for the quality.    During runs, the gamemaster should keep track of how many consecutive days are being spent on shadowrunning activity and whether the character can fulfill their day job responsibilities. If they can’t, they get a warning; if it happens again after a warning, they lose their job.

The aware have astral perception as their lone magical ability, a truly minor ability that nonetheless sets them higher than the truly mundane. The aware have been known for ages as readers of auras, palms, or other forms of psychometry, but simply being able to see magical activity is power enough to serve them as researchers, observing the magic used by others and taking note. The largest place for them, by far, is in the world of security, serving in personal security details to ensure no magic is used to influence negotiations, to keep an eye out for spiritual intrusion, or to direct security details against enchanted intruders. Several have found a place as musicians as well, as being able to read the emotional state of a crowd and adjusting their performance to it is a significant asset.','Positive','SR5:FA',NULL,1,'','',0,''),(303,'Apprentice','15 KARMA','Once known as shamanic adepts, dating back to when they were first discovered in 2011, the rise of the Universal Magic Theory, and the spread of mentors beyond shamanic circles, led to a renaming that continues to be debated in academic circles. More interesting is that there are some apprentices who have never had a mentor, instead following a tradition that doesn’t invoke them, such as psionicist. Regardless of the philosophical side, the thaumaturgical side of this aspect is quite well known. Apprentices may cast a single category of spells (Combat, Health, etc.), summon a single type of spirit (air, beast, etc.) appropriate to their tradition, and have astral perception. This puts them in a middle ground between conjurers and sorcerers, with the vast majority matching their access to the bonuses provided by a mentor. Thus, someone who can summon water spirits is well-served following the Sea, while one who casts healing spells is helped by following Bear. An apprentice is not required to take the Mentor Spirit quality, but most do all the same.','Positive','SR5:FA',NULL,1,'','',0,''),(304,'Enchanter','15 KARMA','Familiar to most magicians as “just talismongers,” enchanters are, in fact, one type of aspected magician, just one that tends to avoid the dangerous life of a shadowrunner in order to shine as a sort of a support network for other magicians. In addition to talismongers, some find work as alchemists, others as artisans and craftsmen whose work contains a magical quality, and still others undertake a dangerous life of questing after reagents, training themselves as dangerous combatants who also happen to have a magical trick in their back pocket. In particular, several people who hunt paracritters, up to and including dragon slayers, are often enchanters behind all the bristling weaponry. Enchanters cannot cast spells, summon spirits, or astrally project, but they have a Magic Rating and may use skills from the Enchanting skill group and related abilities such as searching for reagents. They may also use astral perception. This quality may be selected in place of the normal aspected enchanter for this priority level at the discretion of the gamemaster.','Positive','SR5:FA',NULL,1,'','',0,''),(305,'Explorer','15 KARMA','Perhaps the most overlooked mages of all, explorers possess the rare ability of astral projection, as well as astral perception. The bravest of them serve as trailblazers, testing the limits of the metaplanes, but many simply serve as astral protectors, selling their services to guard areas or provide personal astral protection. Most consider the astral plane to be a fun place to explore as a hobby, but they focus more on their mundane life. While the explorer has neither spirits at their beck and call nor the power of spellcasting, their vast experience in the astral realm often leaves them extremely dangerous, doubly so when facing the more typical mage who has never developed their own skills in astral combat.','Positive','SR5:FA',NULL,1,'','',0,''),(306,'Technomancer','15 KARMA','Much about what technomancers are and how they operate is shrouded in mystery. Though there is no firm estimate of their exact number (since many of them choose to remain underground and not reveal their gift), it is believed that there are fewer technomancers than magic users. Because so little is known about technomancers, many in the world fear what they might be and what they might be capable of. In pop culture their abilities are exaggerated to extreme proportions (they might be shown, for example, shutting down every piece of electronics for blocks), and some groups have put bounties on their heads. Many corporations would like to study technomancers, conducting experiments to map their talents and discover ways to better understand and perhaps duplicate their abilities. Others groups just want them dead. The legal rights of technomancers are hazy and ambiguous— many times deliberately so. The world in 2075 is generally hostile and occasionally very dangerous for technomancers, Many technomancers pass themselves off as ordinary deckers, carrying dummy cyberdecks to blend in. They will often do whatever it takes to keep their secret from being discovered.','Positive','Core',NULL,1,'','',0,''),(307,'Indomitable (Mental)','8 KARMA PER RATING','Bodies and minds have limits, but some people have the will to push right through those boundaries.

Additionally, for each decade of age, the character gains 5 bonus points worth of Knowledge skills, but his physical attribute maximums, including the maximum augmented attributes, are each reduced by 1. At the gamemaster’s discretion, the character may face bonuses or penalties to certain social interactions, due to people’s biases and prejudices about his advanced age.

If the character keeps up with the necessary medical treatments (pills, injections, inhalers, potions, procedures, etc.; the gamemaster can develop a specific regimen based in the illness), the threshold for this test is reduced by 1. The Illness Quality Table shows the build point/Karma bonus, dice pool modifier and frequency of tests for each level, as well as the cost for ongoing medical treatment.

Gamemasters may wish to adjust the length of the three trimesters based on the average gestational period for the character’s metatype. Each trimester, the character gains additional negative effects as detailed on the Pregnancy Quality Table. After the third trimester, the character gives birth, at which point the Pregnancy quality is replaced with either a 15 BP/9 Karma Dependent quality (p. 104, Runner’s Companion or p. 80, SR5) or some combination of Lost Loved One (p. 105, Runner’s Companion), Big Regret (p. 102, Runner’s Companion) or other suitable negative qualities totaling 15 build points or 9 Karma.

If the target fails to resist the spell, the subject perceives with the target`s sense as if it were his own. Any Perception Tests made by the subject using the target`s sense use the caster`s net hits on the Spellcasting Test as the limit. Note that anything sensed by the target does not make a Spell Resistance Test. The caster must touch the subject while casting the spell. The target of Borrow Sense remains in control of his own actions and senses; the subject is merely along for the ride. The subject cannot communicate with the target or direct her to focus on anything specific. Nor may the subject leverage his own augmented senses (including astral sight) through the target`s senses. The subject cannot target spells through the target`s senses. As long as the caster sustains the spell, the subject can switch from one of the target`s senses to another with a Simple Action. Senses that the subject does not normally have can be borrowed (such as bat sonar). Note that a target`s astral sight is considered a separate sense for purposes of this spell (i.e., the subject can borrow sight or astral sight, but not both at the same time).

The hits on the Spellcasting + Magic Test become the spell`s effective Strength and Agility. You can use skills remotely with Magic Fingers, replacing your inherent limits with the spell`s Force. The spell has problems with fine control, so even simple actions such as picking up a coin may require a test (at the gamemaster`s discretion). You can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action, using the magic fingers as if they were your real hands. The magic fingers can manipulate objects within your line of sight, but only objects within a meter or so of one another at any given moment (the `hands` can`t be farther away from each other than your arm span).

Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases. Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. The wall is translucent but shimmers, the equivalent of Light Fog (p. 175). The barrier does not impede spellcasting (other than visibility penalties), except for spells with physical components like indirect combat spells.

Every net hit reduces the target`s Agility by 1. If Agility is reduced to 0, the target is bound and unable to move his limbs. While bound by the spell, the target may attempt to crawl or hop short distances (at one-quarter their normal movement rate). Bound targets may still defend and dodge against attacks, but they suffer a dice-pool modifier equal to the caster`s net hits. A bound target may attempt to break free of the bindings by making an Opposed Test, pitting Strength + Body against the spell`s Force x 2.  Bind works on single targets, while Net Bind is an area spell.

The spell sends a pulse of flame in a single direction with the caster’s first action once every Combat Turn as long as it is sustained, without damaging its point of origin (the caster). Everything else in its path, though, is damaged.','Combat','Direct, Elemental','Physical','S(A)','P','S','F+1','SR5:SSp',NULL),(203,'Magebolt','This spell harnesses destructive magical energy and damages a living Awakened target or spirit through release of energy inside of the target. The spell only affects creatures that are Awakened or dual natured.

Currently it is generally used by mages with corporate or military connections, though it’s starting to be used by shadowrunners as well. The family of spells functions the same, but each element counts as a separate spell. The currently available variants are: acid, cold, electricity, fire, pollution, radiation, and water. The spell creates a solid ball of energy roughly the size of a grapefruit in the caster’s hands. The spell then launches from the caster as a grenade launcher (p. 182, SR5) without a minimum range. The ball is affected by physical barriers and can bounce off solid surfaces and around corners. The spellcaster must make a Magic + [Tradition Attribute] (3) Test to see how close the spell grenade lands to its target, where Tradition Attribute is the Attribute used along with Willpower to resist Drain. This test takes the place of the Throwing Weapons + Agility Test used for grenades (see Grenades, p. 181, SR5). Scatter should also be determined as it is with grenades (p. 182, SR5). The grenade spell explodes when the caster uses a Simple Action to detonate it or the combat turn ends, whichever happens first. The rules for blasts against barriers (p.183, SR5) apply to the spell’s effects, along with the previously mentioned elemental effects.','Combat','Indirect, Elemental','Physical','T','P','I','F-1','SR5:SSp',NULL),(205,'Sunbeam','Developed under contract with the Kingdom of Benin by Mitsuhama, Sunbeam was intended to give spellcasters an advantage against HMHVV-Infected invaders or infiltrators from Asamando. The spell creates an instantaneous beam of sunlight directed at the target. Intended to take advantage of ghouls’ vulnerability to sunlight, it has proven effective against other sufferers of the virus. The spell is not very useful against targets without any Allergy to sunlight; it does half the normal damage (rounded up) as Stun damage. Damage resolution is handled as explained in Indirect Combat Spells (p. 283, SR5). Against targets who have the Allergy (sunlight) weakness, however, the spell’s Damage Value is increased to twice what it normally is, and it always inflicts Physical damage regardless of the target’s armor value. All targets must deal with the bright glare of the spell; any target hit by the spell (whether it does damage or not) receives a –1 dice pool penalty to their next attack due to glare (flare compensation of any kind removes this penalty).','Combat','Indirect','Physical','LOS','P','I','F-1','SR5:SSp',NULL),(206,'Passenger','This variant of the Borrow Sense Spell (p. 102, Street Grimoire) enables the caster to borrow all of the senses from the chosen target.','Detection','Passive, Psychic','Mana','LOS','','I','F-1','SR5:SSp',NULL),(207,'Recorded Room','This spell makes a visual image of a room, including any details not readily visible to an observer’s perspective, such as a chair behind a desk. It also copies any readily visible electronic displays or printed material. If something is obscured by another object, like a piece of paper partially covered by a book, only the readily visible characters are recorded. As a Complex Action, the caster can alter their perspective and observe any details (Detection Spell Results, p. 286, SR5) within the room while sustaining the spell.','Detection','Passive, Area','Physical','LOS(A)','','S','F','SR5:SSp',NULL),(208,'Secret Handshake','This spell is popular with spellcasters of clandestine organizations. It allows them to make rendezvous without electronic signals or records for mundane investigators to sift through. The spell detects other versions of itself, but only if they are from the same spell formula. Each formula is specific enough to be invisible to a practitioner using a different formula of the spell.','Detection','Active, Area','Mana','T','','S','F-4','SR5:SSp',NULL),(209,'Broadcast','These spells function in a similar manner as Mindlink, allowing the target to communicate with all intelligent beings within range. The communication is one-way only, primarily intended to issue commands to subordinates, rather than act as a tactical communications system. Everyone within the area of effect receives the message, although targets can attempt to resist by using Willpower, as if it were a Direct Combat spell (p. 283, SR5).','Detection','Active, Area','Mana','T','','S','F+1','SR5:SSp',NULL),(210,'Sending','These spells function in a similar manner as Mindlink, allowing the target to communicate with all intelligent beings within range.

The spell causes (Force)P damage on the first Combat Turn, (Force – 1)P damage the second Combat Turn, and continues to decrease by one in each subsequent Combat Turn until it reaches zero. Each time damage is inflicted, the subject resists with a Body + Counterspelling Test. The damage occurs immediately before the subject’s first action each Combat Turn.','Health','Essence, Negative','Physical','T','','I','F','SR5:SSp',NULL),(213,'Decontamination','This spell is used to reduce the effects of radiation poisoning on a patient due to radiation contamination. The character receives additional dice to their Radiation Resistance Test (p. 18) equal to the spell’s net hits. It does not repair any existing radiation damage; that requires a separate Heal spell (p. 288, SR5).','Health','','Mana','T','','P','F-4','SR5:SSp',NULL),(214,'Dehydrate','The spell’s subject suffers from nausea and disorientation (p. 409, SR5) while the spell is sustained (unless the spell is resisted).','Health','Negative','Physical','T','','S','F-4','SR5:SSp',NULL),(215,'Ghoulish Strength','Ghoulish Strength was developed by unknown sources and taught to three ghoul shamans in the Boston sprawl. It is believed the same group that created it has disseminated it to the other ghoul packs. The spell only affects sufferers of the HMHVV virus. The spell increases the Strength of the subject by one for each net hit, to their augmented maximum.','Health','Essence','Physical','T','','S','F-4','SR5:SSp',NULL),(216,'Healthy Glow','Healthy Glow is a popular spell with the well-to-do, or those who want to appear well-to-do. This spell improves the appearance of the subject by improving their circulation, brightening their appearance and improving their general health. The effect is permanent but can be marred through hard living and natural aging. Hits on the Spellcasting Test [limited by Force] determine how well the subject is cleaned up. The spell has two effects—increasing the Social limit of the target, and providing a modifier to First Aid or Medicine Tests (per Healing Modifiers, p. 208, SR5 or modifiers to Health spells, p. 287, SR5). The Social limit increases by 1 for every two hits (rounded up) on the Spellcasting Test, while the Healing Modifier is 1 for every 3 hits on the Spellcasting Test (rounded up). These effects last for 24 hours; after that, the health effects vanish, and people adjust to the new appearance, so the increased Social limit disappears as well.','Health','','Physical','T','','P','F-2','SR5:SSp',NULL),(217,'Hydrate','This spell rehydrates a subject, limiting the effect of prolonged exposure to the elements.

It also counters the Dehydrate spell (p. 18).','Health','','Physical','T','','P','F-4','SR5:SSp',NULL),(218,'Inflict Disease','One of the reasons to never jilt an Awakened lover, this spell infects the subject with a disease like VITAS—or like one of the more personal, socially harder-to-explain ones. The Force of the spell becomes the Power of the disease. The spell cannot inflict a disease that is magically based, like HMHVV. Net successes do not affect the Power of the disease; the successes are solely used to determine if the target is inflicted with the disease or not. After the Spell Resistance Test, the subject must make a Disease Resistance Test (Body + protective systems rating). If the Resistance Test does not reduce the Power to zero, the subject starts showing symptoms the following Combat Turn (symptoms depend on the disease inflicted on the target; see the Sample Diseases table for examples). Resistance Tests continue to be made each Combat Turn until the Power is reduced to zero.','Health','Negative, Essence','Mana','T','','P','F-3','SR5:SSp',NULL),(219,'Nauseate','The target suffers from Nausea (p. 409, SR5) if they fail to resist.

Each net hit reduces the duration of the Nausea by 1 Combat Turn. In addition, while the spell is maintained wound effects are not doubled. The effect of Nausea returns at full force once the spell is no longer sustained (as long as the force causing the Nausea remains in effect).','Health','','Mana','T','','S','F-4','SR5:SSp',NULL),(221,'Personal Warmth','Personal Warmth maintains the body temperature of one or more metahumans at healthy levels. The number of metahumans covered is equal to the number of net hits [limited by Force] achieved with Spellcasting Test. The recipients must be in the caster’s line of sight for the spell to affect them when it is cast, but they do not need to remain there while the spell is sustained. The spell does not offer a defense against cold-based attacks.','Health','','Mana','LOS','','S','F-4','SR5:SSp',NULL),(222,'Rot','Rot is a spell preferred by casters who want their opponents to suffer horribly as they die. The UCAS military requires all members who learn this spell to undergo regular psychological screening as a precaution against it being misused. The spell kills flesh in a localized area of the target’s body. If the caster gets at least 2 net successes after the target’s Resistance Test, the caster kills the flesh near the contact point. With 2 or 3 net successes, the caster can destroy a hand or foot. With 4 or more net successes, the caster can destroy an entire limb. If the torso is touched, the effect kills internal organs; with 2 or 3 successes a single organ is destroyed, with 4 or more successes multiple organs are destroyed. For each organ destroyed, the target’s Body is reduced by 1. Unless the spell does enough damage to kill the target (that is, reducing Body to 0), life-sustaining organs (brain, heart etc.) cannot be selected for destruction. The damage from this spell requires treatment from a medical facility to deal with the dead tissue. The Heal spell cannot repair damage caused by this spell.','Health','Essence, Negative','Physical','T','','I','F','SR5:SSp',NULL),(223,'Vampiric Speed','A new favorite for those afflicted with HMHVV, Vampiric Speed centers itself on the caster, increasing the speed of any HMHVV-infected beings within its radius.

Additionally, the speed boost increases their Initiative Score by +1 per hit (without directly increasing the Reaction or Intuition attribute).','Health','Essence','Physical','S(A)','','S','F-2','SR5:SSp',NULL),(224,'False Impression','This spell is designed to pass illusions to the target’s','Illusion','','Mana','LOS','','S','F-4','SR5:SSp',NULL),(225,'Manascape','This spell is designed to pass illusions to the target’s','Illusion','','Mana','LOS(A)','','S','F-2','SR5:SSp',NULL),(226,'Vampiric Stealth','Knowledge of this spell is primarily based on speculation developed from astral forensic observation and a partial spell formulae recovered by a Knight Errant task force. This spell affects the ability of the caster to move unseen about the Sixth World. The caster must suffer from HMHVV for the spell to have any effect. The spell provides the caster a dice pool modifier to Sneaking Tests equal to the Spellcasting Test hits (maximum 5).','Illusion','','Mana','S','','S','F-3','SR5:SSp',NULL),(227,'Air Filter','This spell allows the subject to breathe while buried or while underwater.

The net hits scored by the caster determine the quality and the complexity of an implanted memory. Every [Force] months, or anytime the character is presented with evidence the memory is false, or has been removed, the subject may attempt a Willpower Test. Each hit reduces the hits on the caster’s original Spellcasting Test. When the total reaches 0, the spell no longer has any effect. The original memories are restored, and the false ones revealed.','Manipulation','Mental','Mana','LOS','','P','F+1','SR5:SSp',NULL),(229,'Alter Temperatre','Alter Temperature changes the ambient temperature in','Manipulation','Physical','Physical','LOS(A)','','S','F-3','SR5:SSp',NULL),(230,'Astral Armor','This spell is an Armor spell for the astral plane (p. 292, SR5).

The subject feels the emotion wholeheartedly, and it affects their physical performance in a manner consistent with the emotion, conducting actions opposed to the emotion invoke a –2 dice pool penalty. For example, subjects feeling rage engaging in combat suffer no penalties, whereas if the subject were attempting negotiations the negative modifier would apply.

Objects can pass into and out of the spell’s effect without being inhibited. The temperature of objects is not changed, only the caster’s ability to touch and interact with those objects. The spell must be cast on an area, not an individual, and the area of effect cannot move.

The burst also erases any standard RFID tags in the affected area and may damage any non-optical based computer systems. While most systems since 2050 have been optical based, there are still a few throwback, unshielded systems in use. Affected systems may suffer data loss, power outages, or a complete systems failure depending on a Defense Test using the applicable Object Resistance Rating (p. 295, SR5).

The fibers can be turned on and off via wireless command if you have a smartgun—if not, pressing two buttons at the same time does the trick. The mod gives a +6 bonus on any tests to see if a character keeps grip on the gun. This can go on any weapon with a grip, whether they have a stock slot or not; if they have a stock slot, this takes it up.','','SR5:R&G','',1,1,0),(33,'Guncam','Top, Under, Barrel, Side, Internal','4','350¥','The device that launched a thousand stupid-ass MeFeed videos. Whatever the gun is pointing at, it records. Yeah, you don’t always want a record of what you’re about to shoot, but sometimes that footage is invaluable—whether you need to show Mr. Johnson what you managed to pull off, review footage to help you plan your next move, or doctor what you filmed to make you look good, the video you film has plenty of possible uses.

It combines three technologies microwave, laser, and radar—to give you an extremely accurate calculation of range. The effect of this is to reduce range modifiers by 1. This only can be used in weapons that have a smartlink; it can be positioned in any slot besides the one that has the smartlink.

For guerilla warriors, this might be a piece of rope, and old belt, or anything else that can be rigged up to help them keep from dropping their weapon. No matter how complex or simple, the function is basic—it makes sure your weapon doesn’t fall to the ground when you’re running or diving from an explosion or in the middle of being shot or whatever.

Depends on how you function. If meta-to-meta interaction is how you prefer to get your information, you might want a weapon personality, which provides a metahuman-like interface so you can chat away.
