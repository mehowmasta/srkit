Breath, cellular, and DNA scanners collect a sample of the user’s cells, either off the finger/palm, via hair suction, through exhaled particles, or something similar, and analyze the genetic material. In order to fool such a system, you need a sample of the correct genetic material, preserved in a specially formulated enzyme bath. The enzyme bath can be synthesized in a chemistry shop with a Chemistry + Logic (5, 1 hour) Extended Test.
Facial recognition scanners use imaging lasers, thermographic, and/or ultrasonic waves to map a person’s face.

Solid citizens receive their SINs at birth and carry them until they die. Not having a SIN means living outside the system, living with restricted or non-existent civil rights. Shadowrunners by default are SINless—they have a SIN only if they have the SINner quality (p. 84). Most runners don’t have one, either because they were unfortunate enough to be born poor, or because they lost it or ditched it somewhere along the way. SINs are digital, not physical objects. They exist on your commlink, or in your PAN. Getting by without a SIN can be a pain, so most runners settle for the next best thing: a fake. High quality fakes are difficult for The Man to spot; low quality fakes are … less good. The rating of the fake SIN is used in tests against verification systems (Fake SINs, p. 367) . Just like a real SIN, anytime you use a fake SIN for legitimate activity, you leave a datatrail in your wake. The fact that criminal activities can be tracked to fake SINs makes fake SINs inherently disposable. Most runners operate two or more fake SINs at a time, one for legal activity like paying rent and going shopping, another for shadier activity, and possibly a third to be used only when it’s time to get the hell outta Dodge.",Core,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,,,0,0,,0,

Each type of item/activity permission requires a separate license. Things that require licenses include hunting (bow and rifle), possession of a firearm, concealed carry of a firearm (separate license), spellcasting, and any Restricted gear or augmentations, etc. Just as SINs essentially exist on your commlink, fake licenses exist on your SIN and are linked to it. When you buy a fake concealed-carry license, you don’t buy it for Murderman the professional shadowrunner, you buy it for John Doe, one of Murderman’s fake SINs.
