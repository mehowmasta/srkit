16,"MCT Trainee",1,"2 1 1 2",1,1,3R,"17,250¥",SR5:DT,"A spider’s got to start somewhere, and Mitsuhama starts theirs with cybercombat training decks. These decks have built-in Biofeedback Filter programs to keep the trainees (relatively) safe. Though if you take one into the wilds of the Matrix, you’d better be ready for the demiGODs to get creative in the ways they cause you pain."
17,"C-K Analyst",2,"1 5 4 3",1,1,5R,"83,800¥",SR5:DT,"The Cantor-Kurosawa Analyst is what every investigative journalist needs to poke around without being noticed, find the plain truth, package it up, and broadcast it in microseconds. The built-in high-def camera and recording suite, complemented by the hardwired Edit program, will make you look like a million nuyen as you tell it like it is to the world."
18,"Aztechnology Emissary",3,"2 3 3 8",1,1,8R,"168,000¥",SR5:DT,"For the courier on the go, this deck is designed to carry and protect files. It’s also handy for protecting slaved devices and your own wetware. Just don’t make the mistake of many a medieval noble who wandered out from behind their walls to engage the enemy. Being strong on defense is not the same as being skilled in attack."
19,"Yak Killer",3,"7 6 2 3",2,1,13R,"194,000¥",SR5:DT,"This powerful but somewhat fragile deck isn’t exactly an official product of the Reality Hackers gang of Seattle. Their unusual configuration isn’t exactly licensed, the proceeds don’t exactly go to the gang, and having one won’t exactly make you the gang’s best friend, but it’s a popular model among up-and-coming deck-trippers."
20,"Ring of Light Special",4,"8 1 2 6",3,1,10R,"242,000¥",SR5:DT,"If you haven’t heard of the trid show, Ring of Light, welcome back to civilization from your cave-dwelling sabbatical. The decks used by the virtual fighters in this digital cage match are now for sale to the public, and are required for RoL-sanctioned local events and feeder leagues. They’re about as stealthy as a troll riding a rhino through a library, but stealth makes for bad trid."
21,"Ares Echo Unlimited",5,"9 6 4 5",3,1,15R,"395,900¥",SR5:DT,"This deck puts the “special” in special forces. It is ruggedized for hard combat missions with security contractors like Hard Corps and Wolverine, along with a number of government and civilian security organizations."
