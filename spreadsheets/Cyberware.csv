When dormant, the pump is merely a reservoir for adrenaline. When activated, a small muscular sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrated adrenaline into the blood stream. Physical and emotional stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure Test (p. 152); otherwise you can trigger it as a Free Action.While the pump is active, you ignore injury modifiers and donâ€™t fall unconscious, even if your Stun Condition Monitor is filled. You canâ€™t rest, but the adrenaline pumpâ€™s Rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower attributes. The pump works for Rating x 1D6 Combat Turns (the pump canâ€™t be switched off early). When timeâ€™s up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to the number of Combat Turns the pump was active (use your natural Body + Willpower to resist the damage).After the effects end, your attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or unconsciousness from Stun damage.

The chemical gland is a small organic sac that produces a single substance. Often implanted in place of the appendix, the chemical gland can also be located in many other spots inside the body, such as the roof of the mouth so it can be used with fangs, or perhaps near an internal weapon system to provide a coating of venom. Even more unusual placements have been dreamed up. Each gland can only produce a single compound, chosen when purchased, and the selection cannot be changed. These compounds must be naturally occurring and not synthetic. The gland produces a single dose every twenty-four hours and can hold as many as four doses at once. An expanded reservoir is, of course, available. Note that the implantation of a chemical gland in no way provides immunity, or even improved resistance, from the substance for the user. The gland’s protective sac keeps the compound from leaking into the body naturally, but if introduced in another way (such as biting one’s self with fangs), the user can be exposed to it. In addition to the base price, the chemical gland’s cost is further increased by an amount equal to the cost of one hundred doses of the chemical compound it produces. The Availability of the chemical gland is 12, or equal to the compound created, whichever is higher, and is Restricted or Forbidden if the chemical carries such a flag.

Only contactor inhalation-vectored chemicals are of much use in this method, and the user must be careful not to inhale until the dose is fully discharged. Alternately, the user can manually activate the sphincter and inhale a dose themselves, a popular approach for many asthmatics. When exhaled, the dose expands in a cone two meters long and two meters wide at its widest point, which may catch multiple targets if they’re placed closely enough.

Unlike normal eyelids, the nictitating membrane slides horizontally and is somewhat unsettling to see as most mammals, including metahumans, don’t possess such a feature. It’s useful in diving, to keep floating detritus from damaging the eye itself, but also on land for brushing away smoke or grit. A tinted version is available to act as a defense against bright light, but this version cannot be seen through clearly, resulting in an either-or proposition that few use. Note that nictitating membranes are fully compatible with cybereyes of Standard grade or better. Standard nictitating membranes add +2 to the user’s pool to resist eye irritants, such as CS gas or pepper spray, as well as ordinary smoke, plus allow the user to keep their eyes open underwater without discomfort.

36,"Spidersilk Gland",1,1,Bioware,Basic,0.3,-,10,"35,000¥","Spidersilk is renowned for its strength in relation to its weight, so engineers have long looked for ways to harness its abilities. By implanting glands that shoot a reasonable facsimile of spidersilk from the human body, people get the opportunity to trip up opponents, or even rappel down a building. Don’t try swinging from it, though—this is not a comic book. Glands are often implanted in people’s wrists; those ones hold two doses, with each dose being about twenty meters long. Glands implanted in the abdomen or lower back can hold five doses. When the silk shoots out, the user can choose to keep it stuck to the gland, or they can snip it off. Aiming spidersilk at a target requires an Exotic Ranged Weapon (Spidersilk) attack. A successful hit does no damage, but gives the target –2 on their Physical limit. Called shots incur the normal –4 penalty, but if successful they can hit the feet, tripping the target as long as the attack generated any net hits, or temporarily disabling their hands if that’s what was hit.

Critter pheromones were introduced first, but some enterprising street scum jiggered around with the process until finding the right blend of scents to influence metahumanity. Animals, which have far stronger scent-based communication than metahumans, are vastly more vulnerable to pheromone influence. When this ’ware is installed, the user must select what species the pheromones are meant to interact with, and it will continue to create pheromones for that species from that point on. (Changing the targeted species is a simple enough procedure that costs half as much as the full installation, replacing the first species with the new one.) It should be noted that critter pheromones have a limited effect on related species (for instance, dog pheromones have some influence on other canines), but these results can be negative. For example, a user who produces cat pheromones may find themselves angrily approached by dogs. Note that only one pheromone producer can be active in an individual at any time. Tailored critter pheromones add twice their Rating to the user’s Animal Handling pool, or their Rating to closely related species.

Some insist that natural voices sound better and that those who are truly gifted should be celebrated. Others insist that there’s no discernible difference in expanded ranges and natural voices, unlike the distorted sound of cybernetic vocal enhancement, and that snobbery is the only reason for pushback. Several stars have denied using this upgrade, only to be scandalized when the truth is uncovered. Indeed, one star, Adrianna Vente, who had a staggering natural range, was driven into ruin based on fabricated proof backing the accusation that her voice had been modified. In addition to the core enhancement, a second, more expansive version exists. While the base enhancement gives the user access to a full eight octaves for singing, the vocal range expander pushes the boundaries even further, allowing the user’s voice to reach into the infrasonic and ultrasonic, ranging from 20 Hz to 200 kHz, producing sounds beyond the standard metahuman hearing range. Combined with a similar hearing enhancement, users can speak with one another at a frequency others can’t hear, an obvious advantage. If the user is a skilled mimic, they can further replicate a wider array of sounds than an ordinary metahuman is capable of. The vocal range enhancer raises the user’s Social limit by 1 for any test where they speak, or by 2 for any Perform (Singing) test.

The radio pulses are able to pass through most solid matter, allowing the user to “look” through walls, clothes, and similar obstructions to see the outlines of what lies beyond. While individuals cannot be recognized at the resolution of the processing, shapes can give some suggestion of what items might be (tables, guns, balls, and so forth). The system is excellent at detecting motion, calculating exact distance (when combined with a math SPU), and accurately overseeing floorplans and the locations of persons and objects in that area. It is somewhat complex to sift through the data for a proper reading (a Simple Action is required), and while it can ignore Invisibility spells (but not Improved Invisibility spells) and many camouflage methods, it cannot discern color, lighting, or texture. The radar sensor uses the same Visibility modifiers as ultrasound but can penetrate a cumulative Structure Rating equal to its own Rating x 5. Thus, a Rating 2 radar sensor can penetrate two Rating 5 walls, or a single Rating 10 wall, or three Rating 3 walls, etc. Radar systems are especially vulnerable to jamming and noise, suffering double the usual disruption.
