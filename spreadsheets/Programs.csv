1,Browse,Common,"This handy browser and search engine cuts
the time for a Matrix Search action in half.",Core
2,Configurator,Common,"When you run this program, choose
a configuration for your deck other than its current one.
This alternate configuration is stored in the Configurator
program. The next time you reconfigure your deck, you
may switch to the full configuration stored in this program
instead of just swapping two attributes or programs, even
if it means Configurator stops running at that point. The
configuration stored in this program doesn’t change
when you use it, so you can recall it again if you reconfigure
your deck to something else (assuming the Configurator
program is running when you want to recall the
stored information).",Core
3,Edit,Common,"This program makes editing easier with a smart
interface that learns your style and can even give you
suggestions. Add 2 to the Data Processing limit for any
Edit tests made while this is running.",Core
4,Encryption,Common,"Activating the Encryption utility gives
you a +1 bonus to your Firewall attribute.",Core
5,"Singal Scrub",Common,"By analyzing the background noise
and incoming signals, Signal Scrub gives you Rating 2
noise reduction.",Core
6,Toolbox,Common,"The memory management utilities in the
Toolbox give you a +1 bonus to your Data Processing
attribute.",Core
7,"Virtual Machine",Common,"This program creates a virtual
memory space in your deck, giving you increased program
capacity at the cost of system stability. Your deck
can run two additional programs, but whenever your
persona takes Matrix damage, it takes an additional box
of Matrix damage that cannot be resisted.",Core
8,Armor,Hacking,"This program works with your firmware as a
second firewall, giving you a +2 dice pool modifier to
resist Matrix damage.",Core
9,"Baby Monitor",Hacking,"The Baby Monitor program uses algorithms
stolen from the Grid Overwatch Division and
keeps track of your movements in the Matrix, so you always
know your current Overwatch Score.",Core
10,Biofeedback,Hacking,"When you’re attacked, this program
laces all of the attacks you make against other icons
with dangerous biofeedback signals, the sort of drek
that Black IC and G-men use. This program only works
if the target is biological in nature (a security spider, for
instance). When your attack causes Matrix damage, the
target is hit with an equal amount of Stun (if the target is
using cold-sim) or Physical (if the target is using hot-sim)
biofeedback damage. This program also applies to damage
caused by failed Attack actions against you. Biofeedback
damage is resisted with Willpower + Firewall.",Core
11,"Biofeedback Filter",Hacking,"This program is like a firewall for
your sim module, giving you a +2 dice pool modifier to
resist biofeedback damage.",Core
12,Blackout,Hacking,"This is a kinder version of Biofeedback. It
works the same way, but only causes Stun damage, even
if the target is using hot-sim.",Core
13,Decryption,Hacking,"The code-cutting algorithms in this program
give you a +1 bonus to your Attack attribute.",Core
14,Defuse,Hacking,"This program creates predictive barriers between
you and a Data Bomb, giving you a +4 dice pool
modifier to resist damage from one.",Core
15,Demolition,Hacking,"Demolition comes with the latest and
most effective Data Bomb-coding techniques, adding
1 to the rating of any Data Bomb you set while this is
running.",Core
16,Exploit,Hacking,"This program analyzes and scans a target
for weaknesses in its Firewall. You receive a +2 bonus
to your Sleaze attribute when attempting a Hack on the
Fly action.",Core
17,Fork,Hacking,"You can perform a single Matrix action on two
targets with this program. You make a single test, with modifiers from each target both counting toward your
dice pool. Each of the targets defend with their own dice
pools. Determine the result of the actions separately
against each target.",Core
18,Guard,Hacking,"This program keeps an eye out for weaknesses
the same way an attacker would, reducing the extra
damage you take from marks by 1 DV per mark.",Core
19,Hammer,Hacking,"Whenever you cause Matrix damage with
an action, this offensive program lets you inflict +2 DV
worth of Matrix Damage. This does not apply against
targets that take damage from failing an Attack action
against you.",Core
20,Lockdown,Hacking,"When you cause damage to a persona,
he or she is link-locked until you stop running this program
or they successfully Jack Out.",Core
21,Mugger,Hacking,"By actively tracking your marks, the bonus
damage from them is increased by 1 DV per mark.",Core
22,Shell,Hacking,"This program uses a set of filtering algorithms
to give you a +1 dice pool modifier to resist both Matrix
and biofeedback damage. This modifier stacks with similar
modifiers from other programs.",Core
23,Sneak,Hacking,"This utility bounces your Matrix traffic
through unnecessary routes, giving you a +2 dice pool
modifier to defend against Trace User actions. Additionally,
if a demiGOD converges on you while this program
is running, they don’t get your physical location,
although you’re still hit with all the other bad stuff they
throw at you.",Core
24,Track,Hacking,"The Track program keeps an eye on your targets
for you, making it easier to find their meat world
equivalents. Add 2 to your Data Processing attribute
when making Trace User tests with Track running. Alternately,
if the target is running Sneak, Track negates
the +2 dice pool bonus from that program. Note that the
program delivers one of the listed benefits, not both.",Core
25,Wrapper,Hacking,"This program overrides the Matrix’s protocols
for icons. While this program is running, your icons
can be anything you want them to be when you use the
Change Icon action. From the lens of the Matrix, your
Hammer program could look like a music file, your Ares
Predator icon could look like a credstick, and your own
persona could look like a Mitsubishi Nightsky. Another
persona can see what the disguised icon really is with a
Matrix Perception Test, but they need to at least suspect
enough to check (Matrix Perception, p. 241).",Core
26,Stealth,Hacking,"This clever program gives you a +1 bonus to
your Sleaze attribute.",Core
