The spellcaster`s net hits determine the dream`s vividness and complexity. Targets who have severe nightmares (requires at least 5 net hits) do not recover Stun damage while they persist, and any rest during that time is lost. The target will vividly remember the dream when they wake up but will not necessarily know that the dream was mystically altered.

This spell does not grant additional verification codes that paranoid security systems might require to grant access to secure areas, but it will help a vehicle sneak past casual security monitoring. This deception is only effective as long as the two targeted vehicles are within a five kilometers of each other. Once the targeted vehicles exceed the range, the vehicle signatures snap back to normal. This sudden switch will trigger an alert by most security systems looking for abnormalities. In addition, should one of the vehicles be destroyed, the effects of this spell are automatically canceled.

In addition to the visual mask, this spell affects the vehicle`s sound, smell, and other identifiable characteristics. Vehicle Mask can also modify a vehicle`s Signature (p. 184, SR5); each net hit scored by the caster can be used to raise or lower the vehicle`s Signature modifier by 1.

The spell imparts a limited flexibility, allowing solid objects such as statues to shamble a bit as if they had joints. You need to get net successes against the target`s Object Resistance (p. 295); larger items (over 200 kilograms) have their resistance increased by 2 for every full 200 kilos they weigh. Controlling the object takes only a Simple Action; objects can also be ordered to maintain their movement while you direct your attention elsewhere. You only have rough control over the object`s movement and can`t manipulate individual parts or components (finer control requires a spell like Magic Fingers, p. 294). The maximum movement rate for objects is (Force) meters per turn, subject to the gamemaster`s discretion. If the object is held by someone else, you need to win an Opposed Test using Force x 2 against the holder`s Strength + Body to break the object free. If it`s fastened, make this Force x 2 Success Test against an appropriate gamemaster-determined threshold.

Against non-living targets, the magician must succeed against the target `s Object Resistance dice pool. Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it is consumed or extinguished.

For example, you might have your target think that FizzyFluid is the best drink on the market, or that he can`t remember his best friend`s name, or that he should let you past a locked door. The target carries out this suggestion as if it were his own idea. If confronted with the wrongness of the suggestion (like when the reality of the flavor of FizzyFluid in his mouth contrasts with his belief that it`s good), the subject can attempt to overcome it using the rules for overcoming mental manipulations (p. 292).

The hits on the Spellcasting + Magic Test become the spell`s effective Strength and Agility. You can use skills remotely with Magic Fingers, replacing your inherent limits with the spell`s Force. The spell has problems with fine control, so even simple actions such as picking up a coin may require a test (at the gamemaster`s discretion). You can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action, using the magic fingers as if they were your real hands. The magic fingers can manipulate objects within your line of sight, but only objects within a meter or so of one another at any given moment (the `hands` can`t be farther away from each other than your arm span).

Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases. Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. The wall is translucent but shimmers, the equivalent of Light Fog (p. 175). The barrier does not impede spellcasting (other than visibility penalties), except for spells with physical components like indirect combat spells.

The barrier inflicts Physical damage equal to its Force. Otherwise, Bug Zapper functions the same as Mana Barrier. Note that this spell does not damage any other types of spirits or astral forms.",Manipulation,"Environmental, Area",Physical,LOS(A),,S,F+1,SR5:SG,NULL

162,"Clean [Element]","Clean [Element] is an area spell that clears all impurities out of the volume of a particular element within range. Each element requires a different spell (Clean Air, Clean Water, etc.). For example, Clean Air could be used to cleanse a room of toxic fumes, or Clean Water could purify a drinking supply. The caster`s hits determine how thoroughly the element is cleaned; slightly muddy water would require only 1 hit to clean, while contaminated runoff water could require four hits to make it drinkable. The amount of an element cleaned equals the caster`s Magic Rating x 10 in cubic meters.",Manipulation,"Environmental, Area",Physical,LOS(A),,P,F-3,SR5:SG,NULL
163,"Compel Truth","Compel Truth is a spell that forces the target to speak only the truth as she knows it. The target can say something he or she believes to be true, even if it is not. The subject may choose not to speak or to withhold information but cannot directly lie. Some jurisdictions (like the UCAS) consider the use of this spell by law enforcement authorities to be a violation of a suspect`s right against self-incrimination. Others have been known to use this spell (among others) to get to the truth in legal cases.

167,"[Element] Aura","[Element] Aura creates a rippling aura of elemental energies around a willing subject`s body, granting her some of the properties of said element. Each element requires a different spell such as Flame Aura, Electrical Aura, Cold Aura, and so on. Said auras increase the Damage Value of any melee attacks by the caster`s hits depending upon the nature of the element. Attacks are also treated asÂ Cold,Â Electricity,Â Fire, or some otherÂ Elemental Damage, and have the armor penetration appropriate to each attack. Any successful physical melee attack against the subject also means that the attacker must resist similar damage from the aura.",Manipulation,Environmental,Physical,LOS,,S,F+1,SR5:SG,NULL

Each element requires a different spell, such as Fire Wall, Ice Wall, Smoke Wall, and so on. The elemental wall may have a height and length up to the spell`s Force in meters. Alternatively, the caster may craft a dome with a radius and height equal to half the Force in meters. The width of the wall can be up to one meter. The caster may adjust this size if he has the Spll Shaping metamagic (p. 326, SR5).  Anyone coming into contact with the wall suffers special damage as appropriate to the element (p. 170, SR5), with a Damage Value equal to the spell`s Force. Note that some elemental walls (fire, smoke, etc.) are not solid and do not block attacks, though they may inflict Visibility modifiers as determined by the gamemaster.

The net hits over the clothing`s object resistance (defense pool for the clothing can be between 6 and 9, depending on the complexity of the material and whether it interweaves electronics into the threads) measure the degree of style in the tailoring. The spell cannot change clothing`s protective value, only its cut, color, pattern, and fit. The weight of the clothing does not change, and it must cover approximately the same amount of area (for example, a jumpsuit can`t be converted into a bikini). The caster must touch the clothing.",Manipulation,"Environmental, Area",Physical,T(A),,P,F-1,SR5:SG,NULL
170,Fix,"Most spellcasters have devoted their efforts towards learning spells rather than mechanics. This can leave a magician in a bad situation when there is a need for an emergency repair during a run. Fix allows the spellcaster to repair damage to non-living materials, including drones and vehicles. The caster must first touch the object and then achieve enough hits to beat the item`s Object Resistance threshold (p. 295, SR5).  Fix can repair any item with a weight equal to the Force x the spellcaster`s hits in kilograms or less. This spell can only repair broken items when all the pieces are present. The weight limit applies to the damaged part, not necessarily the entire vehicle. For example, if you have a busted wheel, you would count that weight not the weight of the entire vehicle. Each hit scored repairs 1 point of Structure rating or 1 box of damage. An object may only be affected by Fix once and thereafter may not be repaired again by this spell.",Manipulation,Physical,Physical,T,,P,F,SR5:SG,NULL

The caster must beat the surface`s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5) in order to create the mystical bond. Pulling the two surfaces apart requires an Opposed Test between the spell`s Force x 2 and the separator`s Strength + Body.

Spellcasters can leverage this set of spells to artificially increase or decrease the noise within the range of the spell. The spellcaster is not immune to her alternations of the noise and may indeed be hoisted on her own petard should she attempt to use the Matrix after she has increased the noise.  The spellcaster must achieve enough hits to beat thresholds as follows: public grid (2), local grid (4), global grid (6). Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the noise of the Matrix by 1 within the boundaries of the spell. For more information about the effects of noise and the Matrix, refer to the chart on p. 231, SR5.

Wily spellcasters secretly use Decrease Gear Limits to sabotage rivals and enemies without them ever suspecting the true the instrument of their downfall.  The caster must first touch the object, select a single limit to affect, and then achieve enough hits to beat the item`s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5).

The amount of time the material stays fresh and preserved is determined by the Spellcasting hits; multiply the number of hits + 1 by the time matter would normally stay fresh to determine how long it lasts.

This spell erases standard RFID tags and may affect other non-optical and non-hardened electronic circuit systems within the range of the spell. Most modern electronics are optical-based, but they still have some electronic components that this spell can effect. It also can affect some archaic devices and power systems. All such devices within the spell`s range, no matter who owns them, are affected.  The caster must beat the item`s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5) to affect it with Pulse. Affected systems may suffer data loss, power outages, or burn out entirely at the gamemaster`s discretion. The number of net hits scored by the caster determines the level of disruption of the systems within the range of the Pulse.

For every net hit scored, the caster may decrease the Speed Attribute for the targeted vehicle by one. This spell can be quite effective in slowing a target down during a chase.

First, the caster must beat the material`sÂ Object ResistanceÂ Test and then mentally command it to his whims. The material can be moved and reshaped in any way the caster desires at a maximum Movement Rate of (net hits) meters per turn. Loose material can be moved and re-shaped easily, but material that is connected or reinforced (such as walls or other material part of a structure) must be broken apart by reducing its Structure Rating by Force points per Combat Turn. This spell allows the caster to rapidly dig holes, redirect streams, fill balloons, create a path through a fire, construct a barricade, or create a doorway where one didn`t exist before.  Each element/material requires a separate spell such as Shape Sand, Shape Ice, Shape Wood, Shape Concrete, and so on. Elements or materials reshaped by the caster remain frozen in that form when the spell ends. If that form cannot be supported by the material, it will collapse into rumble. The material/element can also be spread out, extinguished, or evaporated.

Material affected by this spell cannot be used as a material link. Because the spell does not affect biomaterial attached to a living being, it does not kill the various helpful and harmful microorganisms living inside a creature. Each hit scored by the caster inflicts a -1 dice pool modifier to any skill tests made to collect and use sterilized biomaterial for forensics or material link purposes. Shadowrunners often employ this spell to eliminate incriminating trace evidence, especially if blood has been spilled.

Non-living material - including clothing, gear, and cyberware - are not affected.  The target is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage suffered by the gooey form affects the target normally. The goo has a barrier Armor Rating equal to the Body + net hits (see Barriers, p. 364, SR5). Cyberware remains still, as though frozen in amber.

The family of spells functions the same, but each element counts as a separate spell. The currently available variants are: acid, cold, electricity, fire, pollution, radiation, and water. The spell creates a solid ball of energy roughly the size of a grapefruit in the caster’s hands. The spell then launches from the caster as a grenade launcher (p. 182, SR5) without a minimum range. The ball is affected by physical barriers and can bounce off solid surfaces and around corners. The spellcaster must make a Magic + [Tradition Attribute] (3) Test to see how close the spell grenade lands to its target, where Tradition Attribute is the Attribute used along with Willpower to resist Drain. This test takes the place of the Throwing Weapons + Agility Test used for grenades (see Grenades, p. 181, SR5). Scatter should also be determined as it is with grenades (p. 182, SR5). The grenade spell explodes when the caster uses a Simple Action to detonate it or the combat turn ends, whichever happens first.

The spell is not very useful against targets without any Allergy to sunlight; it does half the normal damage (rounded up) as Stun damage. Damage resolution is handled as explained in Indirect Combat Spells (p. 283, SR5). Against targets who have the Allergy (sunlight) weakness, however, the spell’s Damage Value is increased to twice what it normally is, and it always inflicts Physical damage regardless of the target’s armor value.

209,Broadcast,"These spells function in a similar manner as Mindlink, allowing the target to communicate with all intelligent beings within range. The communication is one-way only, primarily intended to issue commands to subordinates, rather than act as a tactical communications system. Everyone within the area of effect receives the message, although targets can attempt to resist by using Willpower, as if it were a Direct Combat spell (p. 283, SR5).",Detection,"Active, Area",Mana,T,,S,F+1,SR5:SSp,NULL

212,"Convert Blood to Ichor","This spell converts the target’s blood to inorganic liquid, causing physical damage to the target as their organs stop receiving nutrients and oxygen. The spell causes (Force)P damage on the first Combat Turn, (Force – 1)P damage the second Combat Turn, and continues to decrease by one in each subsequent Combat Turn until it reaches zero. Each time damage is inflicted, the subject resists with a Body + Counterspelling Test. The damage occurs immediately before the subject’s first action each Combat Turn.",Health,"Essence, Negative",Physical,T,,I,F,SR5:SSp,NULL
213,Decontamination,"This spell is used to reduce the effects of radiation poisoning on a patient due to radiation contamination. The character receives additional dice to their Radiation Resistance Test (p. 18) equal to the spell’s net hits. It does not repair any existing radiation damage; that requires a separate Heal spell (p. 288, SR5).",Health,,Mana,T,,P,F-4,SR5:SSp,NULL

215,"Ghoulish Strength","Ghoulish Strength was developed by unknown sources and taught to three ghoul shamans in the Boston sprawl. It is believed the same group that created it has disseminated it to the other ghoul packs. The spell only affects sufferers of the HMHVV virus. The spell increases the Strength of the subject by one for each net hit, to their augmented maximum.",Health,Essence,Physical,T,,S,F-4,SR5:SSp,NULL
216,"Healthy Glow","Healthy Glow is a popular spell with the well-to-do, or those who want to appear well-to-do. This spell improves the appearance of the subject by improving their circulation, brightening their appearance and improving their general health. The effect is permanent but can be marred through hard living and natural aging. Hits on the Spellcasting Test [limited by Force] determine how well the subject is cleaned up. The spell has two effects—increasing the Social limit of the target, and providing a modifier to First Aid or Medicine Tests (per Healing Modifiers, p. 208, SR5 or modifiers to Health spells, p. 287, SR5). The Social limit increases by 1 for every two hits (rounded up) on the Spellcasting Test, while the Healing Modifier is 1 for every 3 hits on the Spellcasting Test (rounded up). These effects last for 24 hours; after that, the health effects vanish, and people adjust to the new appearance, so the increased Social limit disappears as well.",Health,,Physical,T,,P,F-2,SR5:SSp,NULL
217,Hydrate,"This spell rehydrates a subject, limiting the effect of prolonged exposure to the elements. Each hit on the Spellcasting Test reduces Fatigue damage (p. 172, SR5) due to dehydration by 1. It also counters the Dehydrate spell (p. 18).",Health,,Physical,T,,P,F-4,SR5:SSp,NULL
218,"Inflict Disease","One of the reasons to never jilt an Awakened lover, this spell infects the subject with a disease like VITAS—or like one of the more personal, socially harder-to-explain ones. The Force of the spell becomes the Power of the disease. The spell cannot inflict a disease that is magically based, like HMHVV. Net successes do not affect the Power of the disease; the successes are solely used to determine if the target is inflicted with the disease or not. After the Spell Resistance Test, the subject must make a Disease Resistance Test (Body + protective systems rating). If the Resistance Test does not reduce the Power to zero, the subject starts showing symptoms the following Combat Turn (symptoms depend on the disease inflicted on the target; see the Sample Diseases table for examples). Resistance Tests continue to be made each Combat Turn until the Power is reduced to zero.",Health,"Negative, Essence",Mana,T,,P,F-3,SR5:SSp,NULL

220,"Alleviate Nausea","The spell relieves the effect of Nausea (p. 409, SR5) on the target. Each net hit reduces the duration of the Nausea by 1 Combat Turn.

The number of metahumans covered is equal to the number of net hits [limited by Force] achieved with Spellcasting Test.

The spell does not offer a defense against cold-based attacks.",Health,,Mana,LOS,,S,F-4,SR5:SSp,NULL
222,Rot,"Rot is a spell preferred by casters who want their opponents to suffer horribly as they die. The UCAS military requires all members who learn this spell to undergo regular psychological screening as a precaution against it being misused. The spell kills flesh in a localized area of the target’s body. If the caster gets at least 2 net successes after the target’s Resistance Test, the caster kills the flesh near the contact point. With 2 or 3 net successes, the caster can destroy a hand or foot. With 4 or more net successes, the caster can destroy an entire limb. If the torso is touched, the effect kills internal organs; with 2 or 3 successes a single organ is destroyed, with 4 or more successes multiple organs are destroyed. For each organ destroyed, the target’s Body is reduced by 1. Unless the spell does enough damage to kill the target (that is, reducing Body to 0), life-sustaining organs (brain, heart etc.) cannot be selected for destruction. The damage from this spell requires treatment from a medical facility to deal with the dead tissue. The Heal spell cannot repair damage caused by this spell.",Health,"Essence, Negative",Physical,T,,I,F,SR5:SSp,NULL
223,"Vampiric Speed","A new favorite for those afflicted with HMHVV, Vampiric Speed centers itself on the caster, increasing the speed of any HMHVV-infected beings within its radius.

228,"Alter Memory","This spell allows the caster to alter a single memory of the target, including the addition or subtraction of a memory. The net hits scored by the caster determine the quality and the complexity of an implanted memory. Every [Force] months, or anytime the character is presented with evidence the memory is false, or has been removed, the subject may attempt a Willpower Test. Each hit reduces the hits on the caster’s original Spellcasting Test. When the total reaches 0, the spell no longer has any effect.

231,"Control Emotions","Control Emotion instills a strong emotion of the caster’s choice into the target, such as love, hate, rage or despair. The subject feels the emotion wholeheartedly, and it affects their physical performance in a manner consistent with the emotion, conducting actions opposed to the emotion invoke a –2 dice pool penalty. For example, subjects feeling rage engaging in combat suffer no penalties, whereas if the subject were attempting negotiations the negative modifier would apply.

The burst also erases any standard RFID tags in the affected area and may damage any non-optical based computer systems. While most systems since 2050 have been optical based, there are still a few throwback, unshielded systems in use. Affected systems may suffer data loss, power outages, or a complete systems failure depending on a Defense Test using the applicable Object Resistance Rating (p. 295, SR5).
