1,Accident,Physical,Complex,LOS,Instant,Critter,Core,"Critters with this power can cause seemingly normal accidents to occur. The exact nature of the accident is for the gamemaster to determine, based on what the target is doing and what’s going on around him. This power isn’t, in and of itself, dangerous, but circumstance and environment can come into play to make it so. Tripping on your own feet in front of rush-hour traffic could be hazardous to your health, for instance.  When a critter targets someone with this power, make an Opposed Test, using the critter’s Magic + Willpower against the target’s Reaction + Intuition. If the critter wins, treat it as if the target rolled a glitch on a test. If the critter scores 4 or more net hits, the accident is treated as a critical glitch—it’s not just an embarrassing fumble, it’s a potential catastrophe. A critter can use this power on a number of targets at once equal to its Magic rating."
2,"Animal Control",Mana,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"Some critters can manipulate other critters, particularly (but not always) mundane ones. This power lets the critters control the behavior of an animal or a group of animals. It has to be a normal behavior for the target animal. A flock of birds, for instance, couldn’t steal a motorcycle or fire a pistol, but they could attack someone, follow someone else, or simply be made to fly away. If the target critter leaves the controlling critter’s line of sight, it can’t be commanded any longer, but it will continue to follow any orders they had already been given for the critter’s Charisma in minutes. The critter may control a number of small animals (cats, rats, etc.) equal to its Charisma x 5, or a number of larger animals (wolves, lions, bears, etc.) equal to its Charisma. This power may not be used on any critter with the Sapience power."
3,Armor,Physical,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"Whether it comes in the form of dermal bone deposits, scales, or just a thick hide, a critter with this power has some inherent protection from physical attacks. The critter’s natural Armor rating is cumulative with any armor worn."
4,"Astral Form",Mana,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"A critter with this power only exists in the astral plane. Only astral attacks or mana spells/powers may hurt an astral critter; physical attacks or spells/powers have no effect. The reverse is also true; an astral critter can only affect dual-natured beings or those on the astral plane, whether through astral projection or astral perception.Critters with this power may manifest on the physical plane in the same way as astrally projecting magicians (see p. 313)."
5,Binding,Physical,Complex,Special,Instant,Critter,Core,"Whether it’s through webbing, a sticky tongue, or some magical force, the critter with this power can make its target stick to any surface the target happens to be touching (often, but not always, to the critter itself). The target may attempt to break free from this with a Complex Action, rolling Strength + Body against the critter’s Magic + Willpower. If the target prevails, he has escaped. If he fails, he remains immobilized until the next time he can attempt an escape. The range of this power depends on how the critter binds its targets; it may shoot webbing (Range: LOS), have a sticky body (Range: Touch), or just be good at sticking to things (Range: Self)."
6,Compulsion,Mana,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This power enables the critter to compel a target to perform a specific action, even if that action might not be in the target’s best interests. The critter must make an Opposed Test using its Magic + Charisma against the target’s Willpower + Logic; if the target loses, he must immediately carry out the compelled action. The victim immediately recognizes that he was compelled to act after this power is used. This power can’t be used to plant suggestions for future compelled actions; once the power is dropped, the target’s mind is his own once again."
7,Concealment,Physical,Simple,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"Critters with this power can mystically hide themselves, other people, or things that someone else is seeking. Concealment subtracts a number of dice equal to the critter’s Magic from any Perception Tests to locate the concealed subject.  Concealment can be used simultaneously on a number of metahuman-sized targets equal to the critter’s Magic, or a number of much smaller targets (cats, babies, rats, etc.) equal to the critter’s Magic x 5. Concealed subjects can see each other if the critter allows it. The effect lasts until the target is spotted or the critter stops sustaining the power."
8,Confusion,Mana,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This power renders the target unable to think clearly. He becomes indecisive, forgetful, and befuddled. The critter makes an Opposed Test using its Magic + Willpower against the target’s Willpower + Logic. Any net hits the critter scores become a negative dice pool modifier for any action the target character takes."
9,"Corrosive Spit",Physical,Complex,Special,Instant,Critter,Core,"The critter’s saliva (or some other chemical it can shoot) is extremely caustic and can be used as a weapon. It’s treated as a standard ranged combat attack, using the critter’s Exotic Ranged Weapon skill + Agility [Physical], with range increments of (Body) meters. The spit causes Acid damage (p. 170), with a DV of (Magic x 2)P and an AP of –(critter’s Magic)."
10,Dragonspeech,Mana,Auto,LOS,Instant,Critter,Core,"Draconic physiology is not capable of vocal speech. Dragons (and some other, possibly related, critters) are able to communicate telepathically with other beings through this power—as many as they like within line of sight—no matter what the beings’ own Language skills look like. This telepathic communication can’t be picked up by technological means, so dragons wishing to communicate with dragonspeech through modern technology must employ a metahuman as a “translator.” This power lets the critter project speech, but the target(s) cannot respond the same way without their own telepathic ability."
11,"Dual Natured",Physical,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"Dual-natured critters are active in both the astral plane and the physical plane at the same time. They can affect both astral and physical beings. They can perceive and interact with the astral plane like characters using astral perception (see Astral Perception, p. 312). Being dual natured, though, is different from astral perception in that a dual-natured critter always senses both the physical and astral worlds; they don’t have to shift back and forth (and, in fact, cannot do so). Their minds are accustomed to processing both astral and physical sensations, so dual-natured critters don’t suffer the –2 dice pool modifier for interacting with the physical world while astrally perceiving."
12,"Elemental Attack",Physical,Complex,Special,Instant,Critter,Core,"Whether it’s a burst of flame or a bolt of lightning, a critter with this power can project a damaging stream of elemental energy. The power has a specific element type—for example, spirits of fire have Elemental Attack (Fire). The power is a ranged attack, with range increments of (Magic) meters, using the critter’s Exotic Ranged Weapon skill + Agility [Physical] to attack. The attack’s DV is (Magic x 2)P with an AP of –(critter’s Magic), plus as the appropriate elemental damage (p. 170), as listed in the critter’s statistics."
13,"Energy Aura",Physical,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"This critter is surrounded by a field of damaging energy, which can take the form of fire, electricity, cold, or the like. The power has a specific element type—for example, spirits of fire have Energy Aura (Fire). The critter adds its Magic to the Damage Value of any melee attack it makes. The damage may have a specific type and has an AP of –(critter’s Magic).  Successful melee attacks against a critter with Energy Aura also damage the attacker. The attacker makes a Damage Resistance Test against a DV equal to the critter’s Magic x 2. This attack has an AP of –(critter’s Magic). Unless indicated in the critter’s description, this power is always on and cannot be turned off."
14,Engulf,Physical,Complex,Touch,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This allows a critter to draw a target into itself or the terrain it controls, smothering or otherwise enveloping the target and causing damage. This is a melee attack. If it succeeds, it inflicts damage equal to its Magic x 2 (see below for specific effects by element), and the critter has engulfed its target in its grasp. Net hits on the melee attack increase this damage normally. The target gets a Damage Resistance Test as normal, using Body + Armor; the attack has an AP of –(critter’s Magic). Once engulfed, a target is trapped and cannot move.  Every time its Action Phase comes up after this, until the target escapes, the critter automatically inflicts damage as above; the target gets to resist each time as above. On the target’s Action Phase, he may use a Complex Action to try to escape. To attempt escape, make an Opposed Test, rolling the target’s Strength + Body against the critter’s Magic + Body. If the target wins, she escapes and takes no more damage from the attack.  Air Engulf
The victim resists Stun as if from an inhalation-vector toxin attack (p. 408). Armor does not protect against this attack, but other protective gear might (Toxin and Drug Protection Table, p. 408). If the victim passes out from Stun damage, she continues to take damage, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal.  Earth Engulf
The target resists Physical damage.  Fire Engulf
The victim resists Fire damage.  Water Engulf
The victim resists Stun damage. This is rougher than normal drowning, because the critter is capable of exerting great pressure on the victim. Victims who pass out from Stun damage continue to take damage after falling unconscious, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal."
15,"Enhanced Senses",Physical,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"This power includes any improved or augmented senses beyond the normal human range of awareness. This includes low-light and thermographic vision, improved hearing and smell, heat-sensing organs, natural sonar, and so on. The actual enhanced senses are specified it the critter’s description. If the enhanced sense doesn’t already have a specific effect (for example, thermographic vision), this power gives a +2 dice pool modifier to tests made using that enhanced sense, as well as +1 to the appropriate limit."
16,"Essence Drain",Physical,Complex,Touch,Permanent,Critter,Core,"This power allows a critter to permanently take away another being’s Essence and add it to its own. Essence Drain can only target physical, sapient beings (characters and non-astral critters with the Sapience power). The target must be sapient (or achieve sapience) on its own; attempts to use spirit pacts or other methods to imbue mundane critters with Sapience solely for use as a source of Essence do not work.  Essence can’t be drained while the victim is actively, physically resisting. They must either be willing or subdued (restrained, paralyzed, mentally controlled, etc.). Essence transfer can only take place through a strong emotional connection, whether that emotion is passion, anger, or terror. The emotion must also be focused on the critter using the power. Abstract terror is not enough; the victim must be specifically terrified of his attacker in order for the attacker to drain the victim’s Essence. Though there is often a transfer of living material involved in an Essence Drain attack (a vampire drinking his victim’s blood, for instance), nothing but the emotional connection is actually required for this power to work.Draining a point of Essence takes an Extended Charisma + Magic (10 – target’s Essence, 1 minute) Test. If the critter is disturbed or interrupted before this test ends, the Essence point is not drained. Lost Essence affects a target character’s Magic or Resonance Rating (see Essence, p. 52). If a target character’s Essence is drained to 0, the character dies.  A critter can only increase its Essence to twice its natural maximum. Any Essence drained beyond this point is lost; the critter’s astral form can only hold so much at a time.  The psychic stimulus of the act of draining has the side effect of creating either agony or euphoria in the victim, depending upon the circumstances of the attack. Willing victims are most likely to feel a sensation of ecstasy, which could be addictive. A willing victim being drained must make a psychological Addiction Test (p. 413) with a threshold of 2.  A critter that drains Essence can pump their stolen life force into other attributes, including Magic, with a Simple Action. Every point of Essence spent may temporarily boost one Physical or Mental attribute, or Magic, by +1. Multiple points of Essence can be pumped into a single attribute if so desired, but only one point can be used per Simple Action. While more than one attribute may be boosted at a time (for example, Strength and Intuition can both be boosted at once), only one attribute may be so increased per Simple Action. The maximum boost an attribute can receive in this fashion is +4. This attribute boost wears off after 12 hours, and the Essence points used to fuel the boost are lost."
17,Fear,Mana,Complex,LOS,Special,Critter,Core,"This power gives a critter the power to fill its victims with overwhelming terror. The victim flees in panic and doesn’t stop until he is safely away and out of the critter’s sight. The critter makes an Opposed Test using its Willpower + Magic against the target’s Willpower + Logic. The terror lasts for 1 Combat Turn per net hit scored by the critter. Even once the fear fades, the target must succeed in a Willpower + Logic (critter’s net hits) Test to gather the nerve to face the critter again."
18,Guard,Physical,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This power allows the critter to protect against normal environmental accidents and hazards (both natural and those induced by the Accident power), such as preventing someone from succumbing to heatstroke or saving someone from drowning. The Guard power can also be used to prevent a glitch from occurring. Guard may be used on a number of characters at once equal to the critter’s Magic attribute. Each accident averted or glitch prevented counts as a service if this power is used by a spirit."
19,"Hardened Armor",Physical,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"There’s Armor, and then there’s Armor. This is the latter. This power provides its rating in Armor, and functions just like the Armor power. It differs from the Armor power as follows.  If the modified Damage Value of an attack is less than the Hardened Armor rating (modified by AP), the attack does no damage. Don’t make a Damage Resistance test for the critter; it might not even notice the attack was made in the first place.  If the modified Damage Value of an attack is greater than the Hardened Armor rating (modified by AP), then perform a Damage Resistance test for the critter as normal. Additionally, half of the Hardened Armor rating (modified by AP, rounded up) counts as automatic extra hits on this test."
20,"Hardened Mystic Armor",Mana,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"This power provides protection from attacks on the astral plane. Otherwise, it functions in the same way as Hardened Armor, above."
21,Immunity,Physical,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"A critter with Immunity has an enhanced resistance to a certain type of attack or affliction. Effectively, the critter has a Hardened Armor rating equal to twice its Essence against that particular kind of damage (see Hardened Armor, p. 397). This means that if the modified Damage Value of the attack does not exceed the Immunity’s rating, then the attack automatically does no damage. If the modified DV exceeds the Immunity rating, perform a Damage Resistance test as normal, adding the Immunity rating to the dice pool for this test. Additionally, half (rounded up) of the Immunity rating counts as automatic hits on this test.  Some Immunities function slightly differently, because the attack they protect against doesn’t do damage, per se.  Immunity to Age: Some things don’t get old. Literally. Beings with this Immunity neither age nor suffer the effects of aging.  Immunity to Normal Weapons: This applies to all attacks that are not magical in nature; weapon foci, spells, and adept or critter powers function normally. If the critter also has the Allergy weakness, then the Immunity does not apply against non-magical attacks made using the allergen."
22,Infection,Physical,Auto,Touc,Permanent,Critter,Core,"This power is the vector by which the human-metahuman vampiric virus (HMHVV) is transmitted. When a critter with this power uses Essence Drain to reduce the victim’s Essence to 0, this power attempts to pass the critter’s own infection on to the victim. To see if the victim is infected, make an Opposed Test of the critter’s Magic + Charisma against the victim’s Body + Willpower. If the critter wins, the victim is infected and enters a coma-like state as the virus reshapes the victim physically, mentally, and spiritually. Twenty-four hours later, the victim rises as a new Infected critter (as determined by its original metaspecies) with a single point of Essence and an insatiable, bestial hunger for more. The new Infected critter must drain Essence from another being immediately.  Player characters transformed through the Infection power automatically become NPCs upon their “death” and are controlled by the gamemaster from that point forward."
23,Influence,Mana,Complex,LOS,Instant,Critter,Core,"This power gives the critter the ability to exert its own will on a target character. It implants a suggestion in the target’s mind. Make an Opposed Test using the critter’s Magic + Charisma against the target’s Willpower + Logic. If the critter succeeds, its target acts on the suggestion as if it was his own idea.  If the target is confronted with the wrongness of the suggestion, the subject can make a Willpower Test to overcome it, the same way that mental manipulation spells can be overcome (p. 292)."
24,"Innate Spell",Mana,Complex,"As spell","As spell",Critter,Core,"This power allows the critter to instinctively cast a single, specific spell. To use this power effectively, the critter has to have the Spellcasting skill. Innate Spells are chosen from the list of spells cast by magicians, and magicians can oppose them with the Counterspelling skill as normal. Innate Spells also produce Drain as normal, and suffer a –2 penalty for sustaining. Critters and Spirits resist Drain with either Intuition or Charisma, at the gamemaster’s discretion."
25,Materialization,Mana,Complex,Self,Sustained,Critter,Core,"Magicians and many critters can leave their bodies and project themselves into the astral plane. Likewise, many astral critters can project themselves into the physical world and form a temporary “body” to inhabit while they’re here. This lets them interact with, and affect, physical beings. Additionally, they gain Immunity to Normal Weapons while materialized. Materializing and dematerializing to return to the astral plane both require a Complex Action."
26,Mimicry,Physical,Simple,Self,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This power allows a critter to exactly imitate sounds, including speech and the hunting calls of other creatures to which the mimicking critter has been exposed. If mimicking something from memory instead of recent exposure, the critter needs to roll a Memory Test (p. 152). Noticing that the mimicked sound is false requires a Perception Test; the threshold of this test is determined by the number of hits scored by the critter with a Charisma + Magic Test."
27,"Mist Form",Physical,Complex,Self,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This power allows the critter to transform itself into a cloud of mist. Shifting into or out of mist form is a Complex Action. When shifting into mist form, the critter transforms itself and any bonded foci it is carrying, active or not.  The mist form has a movement rate of 5 meters per Combat Turn; the critter can control some of its movement in this form, though it is susceptible to strong winds. These can push or disrupt the mist, which can temporarily disorient the critter. The mist form can pass through any cracks or crevices that aren’t airtight. Systems that defend against gases, bacteria, or viral infiltration also stop a critter in mist form.  While in mist form, the critter has Immunity to Normal Weapons. If the being is exposed to a substance to which it is allergic, it is immediately forced back into its normal form. While in mist form, the critter can perceive normally but cannot use any of its other powers until it resumes its normal form."
28,Movement,Physical,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This power allows the critter to speed up or slow down the target’s movement rate. The power only works on things that are predisposed to locomotion: vehicles, characters, or critters. If used on targets other than the critter, it also only functions in terrain that the critter controls. If used only on the critter itself, this power can be used anywhere. The critter can multiply or divide the target’s movement rate by up to its Magic attribute.  Only one instance of this power may be applied to a particular target at any one time. Once the target has left the critter’s terrain/domain, the power ends and the target’s movement is returned to normal.  Using Movement on vehicles is tougher than it is on critters and characters. If the target is a vehicle, the critter makes a Magic + Willpower test with a threshold of half the vehicle’s Body (round up), with a minimum of 2. If the critter meets the threshold in this test, multiply the hits by the vehicle’s Acceleration Rating and add the result to (or subtract it from) the vehicle’s Speed in the next Combat Turn, as if making an Acceleration or Deceleration Test. The critter can continue to make Magic + Willpower Tests to increase or decrease the vehicle’s speed each Combat Turn that it sustains this power and the vehicle remains in its domain/terrain. Based on the situation, these sudden changes in speed may call for Crash Tests (p. 201) for the vehicle"
29,"Mystic Armor",Mana,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"This power functions in the same way as Armor, except that it only provides protection from attacks on the astral plane."
30,"Natural Weapon",Physical,Auto,Touch,Instant,Critter,Core,"Claws. Sharp, pointy teeth. A spiked tail. Whatever form it takes, the critter possesses some means of inflicting Physical damage. The description of this power describes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage Value and Armor Penetration modifiers where applicable. Natural weapons may be either melee or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Unarmed Combat skill to attack with natural melee weapons, and the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to attack with natural ranged weapons. Most natural weapons are considered normal weapons for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in individual critter descriptions.  A dual-natured critter with a melee Natural Weapon can use this power against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter’s normal Unarmed Combat skill and physical Damage Value for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat, do not work on the astral plane.  Critters without a Natural Weapon may still make an unarmed attack. As with regular characters, the Damage Value is (STR)S."
31,"Noxious Breath",Physical,Complex,Special,Instant,Critter,Core,"A lot of critters have bad breath—this one’s breath is actually toxic. The critter with this power can incapacitate targets with a nauseating stench. This is treated as a ranged attack using the critter’s Exotic Ranged Weapon skill + Agility [Physical]. The damage is a toxin attack with an inhalation vector (Speed: Immediate, Power: critter’s Magic, Effect: Stun damage, nausea; see p. 409). Armor is useless, but respiratory protection will help guard the target (see the Toxin and Drug Protection Table, p. 408).  This blast of breath extends in a cone out to (Body) meters and can catch up to two targets who are within one meter of each other."
32,"Paralyzing Howl",Physical,Complex,Special,Special,Critter,Core,"This power affects everyone who hears it, be they friend or foe, within a radius of (Magic x 15) meters. The critter makes an Opposed Test using its Magic + Charisma against the target’s Intuition + Willpower. The rating of any area-effect sound-dampening devices, personal sound-dampening devices (such as cyberware), or hits scored by Hush or Silence spells, is added to the target’s Opposed Test. If the target wins, he suffers no ill effects.  If the critter wins, the target’s Reaction and Agility are both reduced by 1 for every net hit the creature scores; the reduction in Reaction affects the target’s Initiative and Initiative Score. This effect lasts for (Magic + net hits) Combat Turns. If either Agility or Reaction drop to zero, the target is paralyzed for (Magic + net hits) minutes and can take no actions except to breathe. After either effect ends, the target’s Reaction and Agility each return at the rate of 1 point per minute."
33,"Paralyzing Touch",Physical,Complex,Touch,Special,Critter,Core,"This is the Touch-range version of the Paralyzing Howl power. The critter must touch the target; if the target is surprised or otherwise unaware of the critter, this is automatic. If the target is aware of the critter, treat this as a Melee Attack that causes no damage. The Opposed Test to paralyze a target is the critter’s Magic + Agility against the target’s Intuition + Willpower. Otherwise, this power functions the same way as Paralyzing Howl."
34,Petrification,Physical,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"Some critters petrify you with fear. Critters with this power can do it literally. Perform an Opposed Test using the critter’s Magic + Willpower against the target’s Intuition + Willpower. If the target wins, he suffers no ill effects.  If the critter wins, the target’s Agility and Reaction are both reduced by 1 for each net hit the critter scores; this reduction also affects the target’s Initiative and Initiative Score. This effect lasts as long as the critter sustains the power. After this effect ends, the target’s Reaction and Agility return at the rate of 1 point each per minute.  If either Agility or Reaction drop to 0, the target is transformed into a stone statue. He remains a statue for as long as the critter sustains the power; once the power is dropped, the target resumes his normal state and regains Reaction and Agility each at the rate of 1 per minute.  While transformed, the victim is unaware of his surroundings and events happening around him. He has a Barrier Rating equal to the critter’s Magic x 2."
35,Psychokinesis,Physical,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This power enables a critter to move an object with his mind. It’s similar to the Magic Fingers spell (p. 294), acting as a magical “hand” with Strength and Agility equal to the number of hits scored on a Magic + Willpower Test."
36,Regeneration,Physical,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"This power allows rapid healing of any damage a critter has taken. At the end of each Combat Turn, if the critter has any damage on either of its Condition Monitors, it makes a Magic + Body Test, adds its Body to the number of hits scored, and heals that many boxes of damage, first from Physical overflow, then from the Physical damage monitor, and finally from the Stun damage monitor. If the critter has exceeded its Physical overflow damage, it’s not dead yet. It still gets a Regeneration Test. If, after this test, its Physical overflow still exceeds its Body, then it’s really dead.  Regeneration can’t heal everything. Damage to the brain or spinal cord (for example, a called shot to the head) can’t be healed this way. Magical damage from weapon foci, combat spells, most critter or adept powers, or Drain likewise can’t be healed by Regeneration. If the critter is damaged by something it has an Allergy to, it can heal that damage with Regeneration, but can’t make the Regeneration Test as long as it’s in contact with the allergen.  Regeneration is incompatible with augmentations. Critters with Regeneration cannot receive augmentations; surgical incisions close too quickly to perform the implantation. Critters with augmentations who gain this power will reject their augmentations as the power repairs the existing genetic template."
37,Sapience,Physical,Auto,Self,Always,Critter,Core,"Sapient critters are self-aware, capable of making their own choices, and are generally at or above the level of Homo sapiens. While most critters are considered Unaware of any skill they don’t possess, sapient critters are merely Untrained and can default normally. They are also capable of learning new skills if they so choose.  Most sapient critters are mundane, but they are capable of Awakening and possessing a Magic attribute. Awakened sapient critters are capable of learning any magical task they set their minds to, and follow the same rules for magic as normal characters. While no sapient critters are known to have Emerged as technomancers, the appearance of “technocritters” has led many scientists to believe that it’s only a matter of time—if it hasn’t already happened."
38,Search,Physical,Complex,Special,Special,Critter,Core,"Seek, and ye shall find, but it goes a lot faster with this power. To find a target, the critter makes a Magic + Intuition (5, 10 minutes) Extended Test. Lots of things can make this harder; apply the appropriate modifiers from the Search Modifiers Table.  The critter must have seen the thing it’s searching for at some time before the search begins. Spirits may search for anything for which their summoner can provide them a mental image. Critters who can enter astral space may use this power there and do not have to materialize while searching, even if the target is in the physical world.  "
39,Venom,Physical,Auto,Touc,Instant,Critter,Core,"The critter secretes a toxin (see p. 408) that is dangerous and harmful to others. Typically, the attributes for this poison are Vector: Injection, Speed: 1 Combat Turn, Penetration: 0, Power: Magic, Effect: Physical damage. Some critters may have venoms with different attributes—these will be noted in their individual descriptions."
40,"Weather Control",Physical,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Critter,Core,"This allows a critter to manipulate, within reason, certain local weather conditions. The desired weather must be realistically possible in the environment, which means no snow storms in equatorial Africa, for instance. It builds up over time, reaching its peak when the critter completes a Magic + Willpower (10, 30 minutes) Extended Test. In spite of the power’s name, the critter doesn’t actually control the weather; it only summons it and pushes it in the desired direction. A critter can summon a thunderstorm, for instance, but can’t aim the lightning bolts."
41,Anaphylaxis,Physical,Complex,Touch,Instant,Spirit,SR5:SG,"Anaphylaxis is a massive systemic reaction induced by a concentrated burst of pollutants from a toxic spirit. Treat this as a toxin attack with the following ratings:"
42,"Astral Gateway",Mana,Complex,"LOS (A)",Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"The spirit can open an astral rift (p. 28), which forces all nearby objects to become dual-natured and allows even mundanes to astrally project. An astral rift can open to any metaplane the spirit can visit."
43,"Aura Masking",Mana,Free,Self,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"Sometimes a spir it doesn’ t want someone to assense its natural aura. This power functions like Masking (p. 326, SR5) and Extended Masking metamagics.  Use the spir it’s Edge in place of its initiate grade. The spir it can also hide its own use of powers on itself within the mask; only a magician who pierces this mask can see the spir it using such powers. A spir it can mask itself to look like another astral being, but it cannot tr y to pass itself of f as a mundane being unless it is attached to a physical body or has the Realistic Form power (p. 198)."
44,"Banishing Resistance",Mana,Auto,Self,Special,Spirit,SR5:SG,"When resisting a Banishing attempt (p. 301, SR5), treat the spirit as if it owes a number of services equal to its Edge; these refresh every sunrise and sunset and are cumulative with any services the spirit may actually owe a conjurer."
45,"Desire Reflection",Mana,Complex,LOS,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"Desire Reflection finds the greatest desire of a single target within line of sight and evokes a full-sensory illusion keyed to the desire in the target’s mind. Certain spirits use this power to draw in potential victims. The spirit itself can appear as a harmless or pleasing aspect of the illusion at will. To use this power the critter must succeed in an Opposed Test pitting its Magic + Intuition against the target’s Willpower + Intuition. If it scores any net hits, the victim falls for the illusion. Otherwise the power fails to affect the victim.  Left to their own devices, victims act as if their desire were real and right in front of them. If the victim is attacked, injured, slapped, and so on, he may make another Opposed Test to resist the illusion; if the attack or what have you comes directly from a component of the illusion, add +2 to the dice pool. Each hit reduces the spirit’s net hits on the original Opposed Test. If the spirit’s net hits are reduced to 0, the victim breaks free of the illusion. Those who fail are lost and entranced, caught up in the fulfillment of their desire."
46,"Deathly Aura",Physical,Simple,Special,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"The spirit radiates an aura of fear and decay, which taints the surrounding environment. For an area with a radius of (Force) meters around the spir it, the temperature drops by (Force x 2)°C. Also, organic mater ial in this radius decays at a faster rate, aging by a factor equal to the spir it’s Force. This ef fect is not fast enough to noticeably damage metahumans and other large cr itters, but the aura withers plants and kills small creatures such as insects or mice. This aura fills living creatures with unreasoning terror. Someone who wishes to voluntar ily enter an af fected area must succeed in an Opposed Test between their Char isma + Willpower and the spir it’s Force x 2 or else they are compelled to flee until they are out of sight of whatever caused the aura."
47,Devouring,Physical,Complex,Touch,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"Insect spirits use the Devouring power to consume all biomaterial (e.g., crops, wood, vegetation) and most non-living objects. Some flesh-form and hybrid-form spirits seem to derive sustenance from this consumption, whereas others regurgitate the material for constructing parts of their hive. The spirit makes an Opposed Test, using the spirit’s Force x 2 against the Object Resistance (p. 295, SR5) of all possible materials/objects within (Magic) meters (to save time, the gamemaster may choose to roll once for the spirit and then roll Object Resistance for each object or object type). If the spirit gets any net hits against a particular object, that object is devoured. While this power is sustained, barriers lose 1 point of Structure Rating and vehicles take 1 box of damage per Combat Turn. Living critters and characters are unaffected."
48,Divining,Mana,Special,Special,Special,Spirit,SR5:SG,"This power functions like the Divination metamagic (p. 147), except the spirit uses Magic + Intuition to divine meaning instead of Arcana + Logic."
49,"Elemental Attack (pollutant)",Physical,Complex,Special,Instant,Spirit,SR5:SG,"This attack follows the rules for Elemental Attack (p. 396, SR5) but with the following modifications.  Pollutants can take many forms, including biological waste, industrial runoff, biohazardous materials, and so on. Pollutant attacks have a DV of (Magic x 2)S with an AP of –(critter’s Magic). Additionally, once the pollutant has worked its way into the character’s system (that is, after the interval determined by the toxin’s Speed), he must resist a toxin with the following stats:"
50,"Elemental Attack (radiation)",Physical,Complex,Special,Instant,Spirit,SR5:SG,"This attack follows the rules for Elemental Attack (p. 396, SR5) but causes radiation elemental damage, which results in radiation burns, radiation poisoning, and other serious side effects.  Radiation damage is treated as Physical damage and ignores Armor; however, the affected character may add the rating of a hazmat suit or other radiation-resistant gear when making a Damage Resistance Test against radiation damage. Radiation poisoning may also cause nausea (p. 409, SR5), headaches, blindness, or other central nervous system impairments (per gamemaster’s discretion)."
51,Endowment,Mana,Complex,Touch,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"The spirit grants the use of one of its powers to the target. The spirit may still use the power while the target uses it, and the spirit can grant a power to a number of targets equal to its Magic. No character may gain more than one power from a spirit at a time."
52,"Energy Drain",Mana,Complex,"Touch or LOS",Permanent,Spirit,SR5:SG,"The Energy Drain power is used by a number of dangerous critters and spirits in different ways. Each version of this power is slightly different, depending on the entity using it. Similar to the Essence Drain power (p. 396, SR5), Energy Drain allows the creature to suck life energy from a victim, be it Karma, Force, Magic, or Essence. For some creatures, such as blood spirits, shedim, or insect spirits, this power is Touch range, so a resisting victim must be subdued first or drained unwittingly. Other beings, such as shadow spirits, merely require line of sight for this power, allowing the critter to feed off its victims from afar.  Draining a point of Karma, Force, Magic, or Essence requires a Willpower + Magic [Mental] (10 – target’s Essence/Force, 1 minute) Extended Test. If the critter is disturbed or interrupted before this test ends, the point is not drained. If the Extended Test is completed, the critter drains one point of the specified energy, adding to its own or converting the energy to an appropriate rating point at a 1:1 ratio. Some critters, such as astral bacteria or insect spirits, use the drained energy to reproduce, as noted in their individual descriptions. Drained points are permanently lost.  In addition to the drain, victims suffer 1 box of damage for each point drained. Depending on the critter, this may be Stun damage (shadow spirits, astral bacteria) or Physical damage (blood spirits, shedim). Victims who take Physical damage appear drained, withered, and hollow, and are sometimes marked permanently (white hair, hair loss, wrinkles, premature aging, or other strange markings).  If a character’s Magic is reduced to 0, he burns out and becomes mundane. If a critter’s Magic is reduced to 0, it dies. If a spirit, sustained/anchored/quickened spell, focus, or mana barrier’s Force is reduced to 0, it is destroyed. If a victim’s Essence is reduced to 0, they die."
53,"Hive Mind",Mana,Auto,Special,Always,Spirit,SR5:SG,"All insect spirits of a given species controlled by a shaman or a queen/mother possess a constant telepathic bond with one another. Insect spirits may send a telepathic message to one or more spirits in the hive and/or the shaman as a Free Action. The shaman or queen/mother can also use this link to experience any of the hive’s insect spirits (or switch to another spirit) with a Simple Action, similar to the Sense Link power (p. 198) but without range limitations.  The constant buzz of insect spirits in an insect shaman’s mind can be distracting, especially if the hive is agitated. When this occurs, the shaman must succeed in a Magic + Willpower [Mental] (2) Test in order to suppress the background hum and concentrate on something, such as fighting or spellcasting."
54,Inhabitation,Physical,Auto,Self,Special,Spirit,SR5:SG,"Most spirits can only affect the physical world by materializing or possessing a vessel. A spirit with Inhabitation exists on the physical plane continuously after it has merged with a prepared vessel. The spirit cannot be separated with Banishing, and the spirit cannot voluntarily leave the vessel. An inhabiting spirit is only disrupted when its vessel is either destroyed or killed from Physical damage overflow (p. 209, SR5). If the inhabited vessel is living, the spirit gains complete control of the body and access to some or all of the vessel’s memories. During merging, the vessel’s original spirit is consumed (if present) and that character is lost (though gamemasters may decide otherwise, if appropriate to their stories).  To inhabit a vessel, a spirit requires a prepared vessel (p. 135) in a magical lodge with a Force at least equal to the spirit’s Force. Once the vessel has been enchanted, the spirit may use Inhabitation on it. The Inhabitation process takes a number of days equal to the spirit’s Force. At the end of that period, the spirit makes an Opposed Test using its Force x 2 against the vessel’s Willpower + Intuition. The spirit’s conjurer (if any) may influence the result by adding his Binding skill to either dice pool. If the spirit is attempting to inhabit a nonliving vessel, the spirit rolls Force x 2 against the vessel’s Object Resistance dice pool (p. 295, SR5). The number of net hits determines the resulting form. If the spirit gets a critical glitch, the merge is unsuccessful, and the vessel is immune to further inhabitation attempts by that spirit.   The Inhabitation process is trying for both spirit and vessel. If the vessel is removed from the magical lodge before the merge is complete, the spirit and host generally die (though the gamemaster is entitled to make exceptions for hosts). At the end of the inhabitation period, the spirit takes full control over the host; the type of form depends on the Opposed Test results, as follows:"
55,"Magical Guard",Mana,Free,LOS,Instant,Spirit,SR5:SG,"A critter with the Magical Guard power can use the Counterspelling skill and provide spell defense and dispel spells the same as a magician’s ability (p. 294, SR5)."
56,"Mind Link",Mana,Simple,LOS,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"A critter with the Mind Link power can open and maintain telepathic communication with another sapient creature. The spirit can maintain a number of simultaneous mental links equal to its Magic attribute. If multiple sapients are engaged via Mind Link with the same spirit, they may communicate freely with each other as well as with the original spirit."
57,Mutagen,Physical,Complex,Self,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"A being can use the Mutagen power to magically enhance its physical body at the expense of its mental abilities. While using the power, it can shift a maximum of (Magic) attribute points from Mental to Physical attributes. This power can be used by possessing spirits, shifting Mental attribute points from the spirit to the vessel’s Physical attributes. Shifting in or out of mutated form requires a Complex Action. Instead of shifting attribute points, a gamemaster may choose to use this power to generate a new physical feature, like a tail, claw, or new eye."
58,Pestilence,Physical,Auto,Touch,Instant,Spirit,SR5:SG,"The critter carries non-magical, contagious infection that may infect characters that come in contact with it (or its secretions). Treat this disease as a toxin (p. 408, SR5) with the following attributes:"
59,Possession,Physical,Complex,Touch,Special,Spirit,SR5:SG,"Some spirits are incapable of materializing, so they must possess vessels in order to interact with meat space. During a possession attempt, the spirit uses the vessel’s aura as a temporary conduit to the physical plane. The spirit makes an Opposed Test by rolling its Force x 2 against the vessel’s Intuition + Willpower for living vessels or the Object Resistance dice pool of an inanimate vessel. A prepared vessel (p. 135) gives the spirit a +6 dice pool modifier. If the spirit fails, it is forced back to the astral plane. If the spirit succeeds, both spirit and vessel are considered a single dual-natured entity (p. 395, SR5) for the possession’s duration.  A possessing spirit may be forced back to the astral plane with a Banishing Test (p. 301, SR5). If the possession attempt fails or the spirit is banished, that spirit cannot attempt to possess that vessel again until the next sunrise or sunset."
60,Quake,Physical,Complex,Special,Instant,Spirit,SR5:SG,"The spirit can create earthquakes with potentially devastating effects. The quake affects an area with a radius of (Force) kilometers, and the shaking persists intermittently for (Force) minutes. Areas especially vulnerable to earthquakes are usually not areas that receive them frequently, as people in vulnerable areas tend to build dwellings with earthquakes in mind. The spirit makes a Magic + Willpower Test and the number of hits represents the magnitude of the quake, as noted on the Quake Table.  While the effects of an individual quake are highly dependent upon the conditions of surrounding soil, the quality of engineering, and the preparedness of the surrounding citizenry, the following guidelines can be used (generally, a quake includes the effects on the line for its number of hits as well as all the other effects for a smaller number of hits):"
61,"Realistic Form",Physical,Auto,Self,Special,Spirit,SR5:SG,"A spirit with Realistic Form can be mistaken for a normal physical creature or object when it materializes, or it appears unremarkable when joined to a vessel. A spirit that appears as a metahuman would have a heartbeat and a regular breathing rate. A spirit that appeared as an object mimics the object’s normal functionality; for example, a toaster could be plugged into the wall to toast bread (though it would have no Matrix link, making it an antique toaster). The spirit is in no way disguised from the astral plane, but to physical observation appears to any senses to be a natural part of the physical world.  Note that spir its with the Mater ialization power normally only have one mater ialized form. Mater ializing spir its with this power can choose to appear using Realistic Form or their normal mater ialized form. A fire elemental can still appear as a column of angr y flames but might also be able to appear as a beautiful woman."
62,Reinforcement,Physical,Complex,Touch,Special,Spirit,SR5:SG,"This power strengthens the resistance of natural and constructed materials. To fortify materials, the spirit must take a Force x 2 [Force] (square meters, 1 hour) Extended Text. If successful, the spirit’s Force is added to the Structure and Armor Ratings. Multiple applications of Reinforcement are not cumulative, and only the highest effect counts."
63,"Sense Link",Mana,Simple,Special,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"A critter with the Sense Link power can share sensory data with its summoner (and vice versa). The summoner experiences the critter’s emotions (at a low level) and can send simple commands, which the critter may not understand or follow, especially if the command places them in danger. An Intuition + Charisma Test, opposed by the critter’s Willpower + Intuition, may be used to persuade the critter to obey. In addition, the summoner can experience one of the critter’s senses with a Simple Action; with each Simple Action expended, the summoner can choose which sense to experience. Augmented senses (whether they are magically augmented or otherwise) in the summoner do not work through the critter. The range of this power is equal to (Magic x 50 meters). If the critter is hurt while the link is intact, the summoner must resist Stun damage equal to the damage inflicted on the critter with a Willpower + Magic Test."
64,"Shadow Cloak",Physical,Free,Self,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"This power allows a creature to envelop itself in utter darkness, making it appear to be a shadow. Shadow Cloak is useless in full daylight and unnecessary in complete darkness; other lighting conditions make it difficult to see the creature using this power. Apply a –2 dice pool modifier to Perception Tests for detecting the creature in Normal Light, –4 dice pool modifier in Partial Light, and a +1 dice pool modifier in Glare conditions."
65,Silence,Physical,Complex,Special,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"A creature with this power can surround itself in a sphere of silence with a radius equal to the creature’s Magic in meters. Sounds from within the area are muffled, and sounds entering the area are harder to hear by the creature or anyone else. Sound-based Perception Tests and the Damage Value of sound-based attacks are reduced by the spirit’s Magic."
66,"Sonic Projection",Physical,Complex,Special,Sustained,Spirit,SR5:SG,"This power affects everyone within earshot—except for spirits of the same type—and creates a deafening and distracting buzz. The spirit makes an Opposed Test using its Force x 2 against each target’s Willpower. Sound dampers and spells like Hush/Silence provide additional dice to the defender equal to their Rating or the hits the caster scored. Each of the spirit’s net hits provides a negative dice pool modifier on all tests for as long as the buzzing is sustained."
67,Storm,Physical,Complex,Special,Special,FreeSpirit,SR5:SG,"A spirit with this power can send a massive, destructive elemental storm against a targeted area. Icy rain, bolts of lightning, gale-force winds, and more strike the area. The affected area’s radius equals the spirit’s Magic x 100 meters. The spirit makes a single Unarmed Combat + Magic [Force] Test, and all characters, creatures, and objects in the area are considered subject to Suppressive Fire (p. 179, SR5). The storm’s base Damage Value is (Force)P."
68,"Astral Projection",Mana,Complex,Self,Special,FreeSpirit,SR5:SG,"The spirit can astrally project, just like a magician (p. 313, SR5). This power is only available to spirits with the Inhabitation power. A spirit that does not return to its body after (Force x 2) hours is disrupted."
69,"Mutable Form",Physical,Auto,Self,Special,FreeSpirit,SR5:SG,"Spirits normally materialize with the same form every time, but Mutable Form allows the spirit to appear differently each time. The spirit’s aura is unchanged, however. If the spirit also has the Realistic Form power (p. 198), add the spirit’s Force to any Disguise Tests (p. 133, 136, SR5) it makes to impersonate someone. This power is only available to spirits with Materialization."
70,"Personal Domain",Mana,Auto,LOS,Sustained,FreeSpirit,SR5:SG,"The spirit leaves its personal mark over an area of astral space, up to 10,000 square meters per point of Force. Over time this area accumulates a background count aspected toward the tradition the spirit represents (p. 30). The gamemaster determines how quickly the background accumulates, but the process should take months or longer, and the background count should not exceed the spirit’s Force / 2."
71,Regeneration,Physical,Auto,Self,Always,FreeSpirit,SR5:SG,"Similar to the critter power of Regeneration (p. 400, SR5), this power only applies to the spirit’s materialized, possessed, or inhabited form. If the spirit possesses or inhabits a formerly living vessel, the vessel slowly regenerates back to its living form. For example, a wooden homunculus begins to grow new leaves, and a corpse regains a semblance of life."
72,"Spirit Pact",Mana,Special,Special,Special,FreeSpirit,SR5:SG,"A spirit with this power can enter into one or more spirit pacts (p. 137). The gamemaster has the final say on what pacts a spirit can enter into. For rules about conducting a spirit pact, see Spirit Pact (Contractual), p. 136."
73,"Hidden Life",Physical,Complex,Touch,Permanent,GreaterSpirit,SR5:SG,"The spirit uses this power to permanently place its life force in a creature, place, or object. As long as the hiding place remains safe, the spirit cannot be permanently banished or destroyed by any means. The spirit is able to return after a year and a day if banished with its spirit formula, but a character holding the spirit formula may call the spirit sooner.  The hiding place gains Immunity to Normal Weapons with a Magic equal to the spirit’s and Immunity to Age (p. 397, SR5). If the hidden life holder is destroyed, the life force returns to the spirit, and the spirit is treated normally."
74,"Energy Drain (karma)",Mana,,,,GreaterSpirit,SR5:SG,
75,"Vessel Trading",Physical,Complex,Touch,Instant,GreaterSpirit,SR5:SG,"A spirit with Possession may choose to evict the life force of a living vessel, either by ejecting the victim’s life force as an astrally projecting creature or putting the victim’s life force in the spirit’s old vessel. If the old vessel already contains a life force that was subdued by Possession, the victim is forced to astrally project instead. Follow the standard rules for the Possession power (p. 197). Victims placed into a living or nonliving vessel cannot control the vessel like a possessing spirit and are trapped there. The only possible methods of escape is if a free spirit with this power switches them back, the victim can astrally project, or the vessel is exposed to an astral rift or an entity with the Astral Gateway power (p. 194). A victim trapped in an inanimate vessel or astral space will feel his life force ebbing away, and he will die after (Magic or Essence) x 2 hours."
76,Wealth,Physical,Complex,LOS,Special,GreaterSpirit,SR5:SG,"A spirit with this power can generate precious metals, jewels, and other rare items of great value. Where these items come from is a question no spirit has answered. Once per month, the spirit may make a Magic + Edge [Force] Test. Every hit generates 10,000 nuyen worth of mineral alchemical reagents, usually precious metals or gems. These permanent creations indefinitely carry the spirit’s astral signature. The markets being what they are, characters may find it difficult to sell magical gems.A spirit with this power may also create a similar amount of temporary wealth each day, but the next time the suns sets or rises, these valuable items vanish or transform into dirt or other worthless substances. Because of this, savvy businessmen are reluctant to purchase magical gold."
