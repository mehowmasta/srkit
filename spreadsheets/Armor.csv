Though unwieldy, the full face mask also doubles as protection against gas attacks.","Gas mask",SR5:R&G,,"Transmits environmental information."
312,Drysuit,Aquatic,—,6,4,"2,500¥","Drysuits enclose the diver in a sheath of air, sandwiched between an outer layer keeping out the water and an inner layer snug against the skin. Because drysuits work even more effectively in heat insulation than wetsuits, divers use them for dives in Arctic waters or for dives greater than 200 meters that would last extended periods of time.","Drysuits feature a Chemical Seal (with the hood up and face mask attached), Custom Protection (Insulation 4)",SR5:R&G,,"Transmits environmental information."
313,"Diving Armor",Aquatic,7,6,4,"1,750¥","Looks like a wetsuit, protects like armored underwear.","Custom Protection (Chemical Protection 4), –2 dice pool penalty to Swimming Tests",SR5:R&G,,"Transmits environmental information; Swimming Test penalty is only –1."
314,"Arctic Diving Suit",Aquatic,1,8,4,"3,000¥","This stuff takes drysuit tech to the next level. Intended to be used in the freezing waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, this suit adds a nanotech heater under the inner layer to keep the skin warm.","Custom Protection (Insulation 8, in water only)",SR5:R&G,"The suit will keep the diver warm for a forty-five-minute dive before any tests need to be made. It has to be recharged in between dives; charging takes two hours.","Extend the warm diver time to 1 hour"
315,"Evo HEL Suit",Space,8,10,5,"3,000¥","The HEL (Hostile Environment Living) is the everyday dress of space-station inhabitants and astronauts. The thin, tight-fitting, puncture- and-tear-resistant suit covers the whole body except the face, which can be protected by a hood and self-attaching breath and eye mask with an internal five-minute supply of highly compressed air that is usually carried within one of the suit’s many pouches. The suit is made of some of the most advanced clothing materials available, offering limited vacuum protection, as well as protection from hot or cold environments and chemicals. Due to its many useful traits and high comfort, the suit has become increasingly popular with people working in uncomfortable earthbound surroundings as well (at least those for whom the suit’s high price is no obstacle).","Custom Protection (Insulation 4, Fire Resistance 2, Radiation Shield 3, Chemical Protection 2), Custom Fit, Gas Mask",SR5:R&G,,"Records and transmits environmental information."
316,Spacesuit,Space,12,16,6,"12,000¥","If you need one of these, you best know all the specs of the suit and then some, but they tend to design these suits with the lowest common denominator in mind. I carry basic models from all the major manufacturers, each with a basic list of features that align pretty well with each other—generally a life-support system, biomonitor, commlink, standard polarized face shield, and a liquid canteen built in for hydration during standard operations. Don’t get in a tussle in one of these—any damage will threaten the integrity of the suit and result in the death of the user shortly after they hit the vacuum of space.","Biomonitor, Commlink (Device Rating 3), Custom Fit, Custom Protection (Chemical Seal, Insulation 6, Thermal Damping 4), Flare Compensation",SR5:R&G,"Spacesuits require an Agility + Reaction (12, 1 minute) Extended Test to put on. Due to the potentially lethal hazard caused by a mistake in putting on a suit, they come with alarms and warning systems. Glitches cost time or have some other non-lethal effect, while critical glitches can be life-threatening but should not result in the instant death of the vacuum of space. The spacesuit’s builtin oxygen upply lasts for twelve hours. The power supply lasts for twenty-four hours before it needs recharging. Spacesuits require one hour of maintenance for every twelve hours of use. If a spacesuit doesn’t get this maintenance, roll 1D6 each time it is used. On a roll of 1, the suit develops a potentially fatal failure: a cracked seal, an air leak, temperature or power failure, etc. Increase the likelihood of a failure by 1 for every additional 12 hours of use without maintenance (the suit fails on a 1D6 roll of 1 or 2 after 24 hours, and so on). Spacesuits come equipped with five emergency slap patches (additional patches cost 50¥ each). No other armor can be worn with a spacesuit, but the suits can be equipped with armor add-ons and modifications.","Records and transmits environmental information."
317,"Security Spacesuit",Space,15,24,10,"25,000¥","A standard spacesuit for use by security personnel or runners looking to test whether it really is such a bad idea to get into a fight in space.","As spacesuit",SR5:R&G,,"Records and transmits environmental information."
318,"Evo Armadillo Armored Spacesuit",Space,16,24R,10,"35,000¥","This one is kind of neat. With rumors of alien life on Mars, Evo made this little contribution to the SRS (Space Rescue Service). It’s like the security spacesuit, but Evo added an exo-frame and servo motors. It’s also got extra shielding against radiation and electrostatic discharges, which can be dangerous on the surface of Mars. The Armadillo also offers additional protection from suit breaches, thanks to Evo’s BreachBuster™ technology. I’ve also got the new scaled-down version, which is offered to the general public—or at least the part of the general public that can afford to drop tens of thousands of nuyen on a suit for a place only a few metahumans will ever go.","Custom Fit, Custom Protection (Chemical Seal, Fire Resistance 4, Insulation 6, Thermal Damping 4), Enhanced Strength (+2 Strength for Climbing or Lifting, but not on Attack Damage)",SR5:R&G,"As Spacesuit. Self-sealing system prevents one breach (the suit automatically reseals if a breach occurs, but only once). Post-operation repairs requires a Logic + Armorer [Mental] (6, 1 hour) Extended Test.","Records and transmits environmental information."
319,"Magnetic Boots",Space,—,12,4,"2,500¥","In places that lack gravity, sometimes it’s nice to just be able to stick to one place or walk around without using your hands. Magnetic boots are the answer. A combination of electromagnets and tiny suction cups make adhesion to virtually any surface possible.","Custom Fit",SR5:R&G,"Movement in these boots is limited to 1/4 of normal movement rate, with no Sprint Tests allowed. Climbing Tests receive +3 for wearers of these boots, but climbing takes place at half the normal pace.",
320,"Survival Bubble",Space,4,"Rating x 3",4,"2,000¥","This self-inflating mylar bubble is designed for escape and survival in the case of emergency decompression. Or for rich people to entertain themselves rolling down hills, or floating in the ocean. None of those uses are the intended purpose for this thing, but if you’re creative you can find other uses, even ones that take place on terra firma.",,SR5:R&G,"The bubble takes one Combat Turn to inflate around the user(s). The sphere features transparent windows, an airlock, 24 hours of oxygen per person each point of Rating (meaning a Rating 2 bubble can provide either 24 hours of oxygen for two people or 48 hours of oxygen for one person), emergency food and water rations, a homing beacon (100 kilometer range), and a medkit (Rating 4). The Rating of the bubble is how many people it will hold (maximum 6).","The homing beacon transmits supply levels to rescue personnel."
321,"MCT EE Suit",Space,6,10,5,"2,500¥","While Evo has focused on spacesuit design due to their extraterrestrial intentions, Mitsuhama has been designing ways to protect themselves from the messes they keep leaving all over the planet. This is one such effort—it’s a full-body, extreme-environment suit from Mitsuhama and it’s worn by those who deal directly with hazardous materials/environments, especially chemical and biological agents or radiation.","Custom Protection (Chemical Seal, Fire Resistance 4, Radiation Shielding 6).",SR5:R&G,,"Record and transmits environmental information"
