1,Micro,Walker,Quadruped,"Shiawase Kanmushi",4,2,1,0,0,3,3,8,"1,000¥","This is a four-legged “bug” crawler drone that is hard to tell from a natural insect at a glance. It’s ideal for penetrating confined areas, and its gecko-tipped extremities and light weight render it capable of crawling on walls and ceilings; it is, however, quite fragile, and merely being stepped on or a tag eraser can easily destroy it. This drone is operated with the Pilot Walker skill.",Core,
2,Micro,Hovercraft,Disc,"Silkorsky-Bell Microskimmer",3,3,1,0,0,3,3,6,"1,000¥","Quiet and durable, this disc-shaped skimmer is smaller than a frisbee and can even skim over water. It moves with small and rather weak hoverjets. It is easier to spot than the Kanmushi, but still very small. It is operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill; the hovercraft specialization applies.",Core,
3,Micro,NULL,NULL,Goldfish,2/4,1W,1,0,0,2,2,6,500¥,"Sized to realistic proportions and capable of dives of up to four meters deep, the Renraku Goldfish is a prime example of an entry-level water drone, suitable as a trainer for youths who look toward a future as robotic operators or hobbyists who wish to explore local watering holes below the surface.",SR5:R5.0,Submersible
4,Micro,NULL,NULL,NoizQuito,4,3R,2,1,0,3,3,10R,"2,000¥","The NoizQuito was developed as a flying micro drone with a few special tricks. Visually similar to a mosquito, the body of the drone can only house a small number of features. The most prevalent and obvious of these features is the speaker system. The drone can blast sounds as loud as 160 decibels (which is the volume of high-end race cars), which are used to produce distractions and possibly even minor ear damage in those unfortunate enough to be near the drone when it activates. Additionally, the drone’s wings and body are covered in small LEDs that are powerful enough to produce blinding levels of light in a bewildering array of strobe patterns.",SR5:R5.0,"Flying, speakers, strobes"
5,Mini,Aircraft,Insectoid,"MCT Fly-Spy",4,3,2,1,0,3,3,8,"2,000¥","This Mitsuhama drone is the size and shape of a large insect but can achieve substantially better altitudes. It can serve in an “eye in the sky” role and is handy for shadowing people given the fact that it’s relatively hard to spot. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.",Core,
6,Mini,Aircraft,Sphere,"Horizon Flying Eye",4,3,2,1,0,3,3,8,"2,000¥","This spherical flying drone uses omnidirectional thrust nozzles to stay airborne. Just about eyeball-sized, it can roll itself on the ground, though it needs to fly to overcome obstructions like stairs and curbs. A version with a built-in flash-pak and smoke grenade costs 500¥ extra; detonating them destroys the drone. Use Pilot Aircraft to operate.",Core,
7,Mini,NULL,NULL,Condor,2,0R,0,1(1),0,2,4,6R,"4,000¥","Solar-powered and hydrogen-filled, the Condor is a long-duration observation drone constructed with transparent and radar-invisible materials, allowing it to hover in place for days, even weeks, rather than the hours that a conventional drone can manage. The trade-off, of course, is that the Condor is completely vulnerable if detected and unable to flee. While the Condor’s balloon is nearly as large as kitchen table when inflated, when deflated the entire unit is smaller than a bowling pin.",SR5:R5.0,
8,Mini,Aircraft,NULL,Dragonfly,4,2P,1,1(0),3,3,2,12R,"4,000¥","Perhaps the smallest drone-hunting drone in production today, the Dragonfly is designed to follow surveillance drones anywhere they hide and bring them down. A sleek quad-copter design with in-body rotors that are protected from collisions in tight corners, the Dragonfly comes pre-equipped with a chomping “beak” of blades, allowing it to shear through the wings or body of other mini-or-micro-drones, ripping them from the sky. Against larger drones, the Dragonfly can swarm, nipping away in small bites, but it isn’t designed to cut through any appreciable levels of armor plating.",SR5:R5.0,"Melee Bite (Acc 3, Reach —, Dam 3P, AP –2), Targeting (Melee) Auotsoft"

Intended to find opposition command, control, and communication broadcasts, it can listen in passively while running decrypting software. Parked in a hidden location, it can eavesdrop for up to forty-eight hours on a single charge, gathering data by the gigapulse.",SR5:R5.0,"Electronic Warfare (2) Autosoft,"
11,Mini,NULL,NULL,"Horizon CU^3",4,1P,1,1(1),0,2,3,4,"3,000¥","A simple single-fan vectored thrust drone, the CU is a cheaper version of the professional camera drones used by most major trideo broadcasters. The fan traded off speed for stability and whisper-quiet operation, allowing the camera to focus on the target without overwhelming the sound with the typical whirly-whoosh. Hugely popular with the P2 crowd, where it follows them everywhere and records their day, allowing them to do live updates or edit the footage later. The professional version has an improved camera, Pilot, and software, and usually operates in threes (thus the cubed designation), allowing for three camera angles in any given scene.",SR5:R5.0,"Clearsight (2) Autosoft"
12,Mini,NULL,NULL,"Pigeon 2.0",4,2P,1,1(1),0,2,2,8,"3,000¥","Saeder-Krupp’s small Festo subsidiary mastered the art of lifelike simulation for drones, producing the first realistic flying “bird drone” almost fifty years ago. The design has continued to be refined over the decades, and now stands as a work of art. The baseline model is a chrome-plated beauty, but a more lifelike model is available and is commonly used as a surveillance drone.",SR5:R5.0,"Sony Nightingale, Renraku Bluebird"

When it is deployed, it is the size of a large hawk or other bird of prey. Its patented signature-limiting technology makes it a favorite of intelligence agencies and shadowrunners; radar systems and visual and audio Perception Tests all receive a –3 dice pool penalty to spot the Optic-X2.

It is designed to patrol on its two feet like a metahuman security guard and is equipped with blade-arms as  its primary armaments. Furthermore, it has been stylized so its outer chassis represents the traditional oyoroi samurai armor worn by the Renraku Red Samurai, perhaps a subtle jab at a competing mega. A niche item that is seldom fielded, the duelist has two distinct advantages: its humanoid profile allows it to be mistaken for a more-versatile metahuman guard at a distance, making it useful at facilities guarded by skeleton crews, and its blade-arms are allegedly marginally more effective at combating spirits than the traditional drone combat payloads of guns and more guns. This drone comes with a unique Rating 3 Targeting (Swords) autosoft and mounts a pair of standard swords in special weapon mounts.
