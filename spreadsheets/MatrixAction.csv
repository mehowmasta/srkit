7,"Brute Force","Mark Manipulation","Cybercombat + Logic vs. Firewall + Willpower",Attack,None,0,Complex,"You can use this action to mark a target without obtaining
the normal permissions you need. This is the
action for hackers emphasizing their Attack over their
Sleaze, making it related to Hack on the Fly.
If you succeed in this action, you place one mark on
it. You can have up to a maximum of three marks per
icon. If you wish, you may also inflict 1 DV of Matrix
damage to the target for every two full net hits, if the
target can take Matrix damage, which is resisted with
the target’s Device Rating + Firewall.
Before rolling, you can declare that you are trying
to place more than one mark. If you try for two marks
in one shot, you take a –4 dice pool penalty on the attempt.
If you try for three marks in a single swipe, you
take a –10 dice pool penalty.
You can also use this action to hop to a grid for which
you don’t have legitimate access. The defense dice pool
in this case is 4 dice for a local grid or 6 dice for a global
grid. If you succeed, instead of putting a mark on the
grid, you hop to that grid immediately. Using Brute
Force to hop grids successfully doesn’t alert the grid or
its demiGOD the way most successful Attack actions do.",Core
8,"Check Overwatch Score","Information Gathering","Electronic Warfare + Logic",Sleaze,None,0,Complex,"You find out how close the grid is to converging on
you. Checking the OS is a Sleaze action, so the defense
against it will add to your OS. If you succeed, the gamemaster
tells you what your OS was when you started the
action, then adds the hits from the defending dice pool.",Core
9,"Crack File","File Manipulation","Hacking + Logic vs. 2 * Protection Rating",Attack,1,0,Complex,"You remove the protection from a file, making it
readable. This action doesn’t need to be performed on a
file that isn’t protected, of course.",Core
10,"Crash Program","Matrix Combat","Cybercombat + Logic vs. Firewall + Intuition",Attack,1,0,Complex,"You overload part of your target’s memory and scramble
one of its running programs. You need to specify
which program you’re trying to crash; you can learn what
your target is running either with a Matrix Perception action
or by observing the program in action. If you succeed,
the program is scrambled: it ends and cannot be
restarted until the device it was running on is rebooted.",Core
11,"Data Spike","Matrix Combat","Cybercombat + Logic vs. Firewall + Intuition",Attack,None,0,Complex,"You send harmful instructions to a persona or device,
causing Matrix damage to the target. Your attack
has a Damage Value equal to your Attack rating, with
one additional box of damage per net hit, and two additional
boxes of damage for each mark you have on
the target. This damage is Matrix damage (p. 228), resisted
with the target’s Device Rating + Firewall.",Core
12,"Disarm Data Bomb","File Manipulation","Software + Intuition vs. 2 * Data Bomb Rating",Firewall,None,0,Complex,"You attempt to disarm a Data Bomb that you have
detected (usually as the result of a Matrix Perception action).
If you score any net hits, the Data Bomb is removed
and deleted. If not, the Data Bomb activates, causing its
damage and possibly destroying any file to which it was
attached (assuming it was set to destroy the file).",Core
13,"Edit File","File Manipulation","Computer + Logic vs. Firewall + Intuition","Data Processing",1,0,Complex,"Edit File allows you to create, change, copy, delete, or
protect any kind of file. The defender against this test is
either the host holding the file or the owner of the file (if
it’s not on a host). Each action is enough to alter one detail
of a file—a short paragraph of text, a single detail of
an image, or two or three seconds of video or audio (you
and your gamemaster can work out what exactly “one
detail” means). Your gamemaster may impose penalties
on the test if your edit is particularly intricate or tricky. If
you want to perform a continuous edit, such as removing
your teammates from a video feed, you need to perform
this action once per Combat Turn for as long as you
want to keep the edit going.
If you use this action to copy a file, you are the new
file’s owner. If the file you want to copy has protection
on it, this action automatically fails. If the file has a Data
Bomb, the Data Bomb goes off on you (so try to remember
to scan files before you open them).
You can also use this action to set protection on a
file if you’re its owner. To protect a file, make a Simple
Computer + Logic [Data Processing] test. The number of
hits you get becomes the rating of the protected file. A
protected file cannot be read, changed, deleted, or copied
until its protection is broken.",Core
14,"Enter/Exit Host",Misc,,"Data Processing",1,0,Complex,"You enter a host that you have a mark on and your
icon appears there, or you leave a host you’re already
in. There is no test for this action: a host allows anyone
to enter if they’ve got a mark, and anyone inside can
exit. The host might not be so welcoming once you’re
inside, of course, and some IC has the ability to keep you
trapped in a host until you can break out.
When you leave a host, you return to the grid from
which you entered.",Core
15,"Erase Mark","Mark Manipulation","Cybercombat + Logic vs. Firewall + Willpower",Attack,Special,0,Complex,"You eradicate a mark that has been placed on your
persona or on another icon. To perform this action,
you need three marks on the icon from which you are
erasing a mark. You do not, however, need a mark on
the icon that placed the mark in the first place. You
can try to erase two marks in the same action at a –4
dice pool penalty, and three marks in one go at a –10
dice pool penalty; if you go for more than one mark,
all of the marks must be on the same icon and from
the same icon. You can’t use this action to change the
target’s owner.
For example, an IC program has marked both you
and your buddy. You roll your Computer + Logic (with
your Attack program rating as the limit), opposed by the
IC’s rating (standing in for Willpower) + Firewall to erase
its mark on your icon. You need three marks on your
buddy’s icon to erase the IC’s marks on him, but he isn’t
the sharing type, so he’s on his own for now.",Core
16,"Erase Matrix Signature","Mark Manipulation","Computer + Resonance vs. 2 * Signature Rating",Attack,None,0,Complex,"You eradicate a Matrix signature that has been left by
a Resonance being, such as a technomancer or a sprite.
If successful, the signature dissipates. You need to have
a Resonance rating to attempt this action; unlike other
actions that need Resonance, this one’s a real Matrix
Action, and an Attack one to boot, so you risk Matrix
damage and Overwatch Score when you use it.",Core
17,"Format Device","Device Manipulation","Computer + Logic vs. Firewall + Willpower",Sleaze,3,0,Complex,"You rewrite the boot code for the device. The next
time it would reboot, it instead shuts down for good, or
until its software can be replaced (an Extended Software
+ Logic [Mental] (12, 1 hour) Test). A device that has been
shut down in this fashion loses all of its wireless modifiers

a manual handle can be opened, a gun with a trigger can
be fired, etc.) and cannot be accessed from the Matrix.",Core

jump from the public grid to Seattle’s Emerald City local
grid. To do this, you must have access to your destination
grid. If you do not have access, you can use
Brute Force or Hack on the Fly to hop to another grid
illegally. If you’re inside a host, you need to leave the
host before you can hop to another grid.",Core
19,"Hack on the Fly","Mark Manipulation","Hacking + Logic vs. Firewall + Intuition",Sleaze,None,0,Complex,"You can use this action to mark a target without getting
the normal permissions. This is the action for hackers
emphasizing their Sleaze over their Attack, making it
an analog to Brute Force.
When targeting an icon, you put one mark on it, up to
a maximum of three marks per icon. Additionally, every
two full net hits counts as one hit on a Matrix Perception
Test, so you can get some info along with your mark.
Before rolling, you can declare that you are trying for
more than one mark. If you try for two marks in one shot,
you take a –4 dice pool penalty on the attempt. If you try
for three marks in one go, you take a –10 dice pool penalty.

20,Hide,Misc,"Electronic Warfare + Intuition vs. Data Processing + Intuition",Sleaze,0,0,Complex,"You’ll probably be spotted by another icon, even if
you’re running silent. You can use this action to make
a target lose you. If you succeed, the target stops spotting
you and needs to perform a new Matrix Perception
action against you if it wants to find you again. You can’t
hide from an icon that has a mark on you, so you’ll need
to clear those before you can try this action.",Core
21,"Jam Signals",Misc,"Electronic Warfare + Logic",Attack,Owner,0,Complex,"This action turns the wireless device you are using
into a local jammer. As long as you do not use the device
for any further Matrix actions, the device adds any
hits you get on the test to the noise rating for all Matrix
actions conducted by or targeting any devices within
100 meters. If you want selective jamming or directional
jamming, buy a jammer—that’s what they’re for.",Core
22,"Jump Into Rigged Device",Misc,"Electronic Warfare + Logic vs. Firewall + Willpower","Data Processing",3,0,Complex,"You jump into a device that has a rigger adaptation,
usually a vehicle or a drone. There’s a list of things you
need to have in order to jump into a device: you have
to have three marks on the device you want to jump
into, you have to be in VR, the device you want to jump
into has to have a rigger adaptation, and you have to
have a control rig. If you are the device’s owner, or the
device’s owner has given you permission to jump into
the device, you don’t need to make a test. In the Matrix,
the icon of the device you jumped into becomes
part of your persona.
If someone else is already jumped into the device,
you cannot attempt this action until he or she vacates.",Core
23,"Matrix Perception","Information Gathering","Computer + Intuition (vs. Sleaze + Logic if Running Silent)","Data Processing",None,0,Complex,"This versatile and important action is used both for
finding icons in the Matrix and for analyzing Matrix
objects. When you use this action to analyze a
Matrix object or scan the vicinity for silent-running
icons, you make a Simple Test and your hits
determine how much info you get. For each net
hit scored, you can ask for one piece of information
about the object—this could be type, a rating,
how many marks it has on it, any files it may
be carrying, which grid it is using, whether any
silent running icons are in the area, or any other
pertinent Matrix information. You learn one fact
per net hit. If you get a list of marks, you can only
recognize marks you have seen before or marks
left by personas that you have marks on yourself.
Otherwise you only get a count.
If you’re trying to spot an icon that is farther
than 100 meters away, this is a Simple Test: the
first hit lets you spot the target, and any additional hits can be used to get more information about it as
mentioned above. If you’re looking for an icon that is
running silent (after you’ve determined that it’s present),
the test becomes an Opposed Test, with the target defending
with Logic + Sleaze. Net hits are used just like
you would for spotting distant targets, with the first one
for spotting the target and the rest for analysis.",Core
24,"Reboot Device","Device Manipulation","Computer + Logic vs. Firewall + Willpower","Data Processing",3,0,Complex,"The device on which this action is performed shuts
down and immediately reboots. The device comes back
online at the end of the following Combat Turn. The device
ceases electronic functions and disappears from the
Matrix until its reboot time is over.
When you reboot the device your persona is on, your
OS is reset to zero and all of your marks, as well as the
ones others may have put on your icon, are erased. If
you’re in VR when you reboot, you suffer from dumpshock
(see p. 229). When you come back online, your
icon can be on any grid to which you have legitimate access,
or the public grid if you have no other grid access.
When you perform this action, you can choose a delay
of any amount of time between the time the device
shuts down and the time it comes back online. Anyone
with physical access to the device can override this delay
by hitting the power button, which starts the boot process
and brings the device online at the end of the following
Combat Turn.
This action only works on devices. It doesn’t work on
hosts, living beings (like technomancers, although they
can “reboot” themselves, p. 251), or Resonance constructs
(like sprites), and the only persona it works on is
your own. If you’re the owner of the device you’re rebooting,
you don’t have to make a test. You can’t use this action
on a device that is link-locked (p. 229).",Core
25,"Set Data Bomb","File Manipulation","Cybercombat + Logic vs. 2 * Device Rating",Sleaze,1,0,Complex,"You set a Data Bomb in a file. When you do, choose
the rating of the Data Bomb, up to the net hits on your
test. You also need to choose whether or not the Data
Bomb will delete the file to which it is attached when activated,
and you need to program the passcode required
to deactivate it. A file can only have one Data Bomb on
it at a time.
The Data Bomb is triggered when someone attempts
to read, edit, copy, protect, delete, or put another Data
Bomb on the file without using the already-in-place
Data Bomb’s passcode. When a Data Bomb goes off, it
causes (Rating)D6 Matrix Damage (resisted normally) to
the icon that tripped it, deletes the file (if it was set that
way), and then is itself deleted. If the passcode is used,
the Data Bomb doesn’t activate. Instead, it remains attached
to the file, waiting for the next guy.
A Data Bomb can be detected using Matrix Perception.
If it’s detected, it can be defused with the Disarm
Data Bomb action; a disarmed Data Bomb is deleted.

29,"Control Device","Device Manipulation",None,"Data Processing",Varies,0,Variable,"You perform an action through a device you control
(or at least control sufficiently), using your commlink or
deck like a remote control or video-game controller. The
dice pool of any test you make using this action uses the
rating of the appropriate skill and attribute you would use
if you were performing the action normally. For example,
firing a drone-mounted weapon at a target requires a
Gunnery + Agility test, and using a remote underwater
welder calls for a Nautical Mechanic + Logic test. All actions
you take while controlling a device use either the
normal limit for that action or your Data Processing rating,
whichever is lower. If there is no test associated with the
action you want the device to perform (such as unlocking
a maglock or ejecting a clip from a pistol), you must succeed
in an Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Sleaze] v. Intuition
+ Firewall test to perform the action.
You can use this action to control multiple devices
at once. If you are the owner of all devices being commanded
and they are all being commanded to do exactly
the same thing, taking this action costs nothing extra.
Otherwise, you must split your dice pool into a number
of groups equal to the number of devices you want to
control with a single action.
The type of action this is (i.e., Free, Simple, Standard,
and Complex) is the same as the type of action attempted
with the device, and it requires 1 mark for Free Actions,
2 marks for Simple Actions, and 3 marks for Standard

this information usually requires you to find and enter
the hosts in which the data is hidden. You can then make
a Matrix Search within the host, using a base time of
1 minute (regardless of the kind of information you’re looking for). This only works if the information is at
